We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, PANAKA will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.

I don\\'t think she liked me watching her.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : What is she thinking?\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : She programmed ARTOO to warn us if there\\'s an intruder.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : It\\'s not an intruder I\\'m worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don\\'t we, Master?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : You\\'re using her as bait?\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : It was her idea. Don\\'t worry. No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : It\\'s too risky and your senses aren\\'t that attuned, young apprentice.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : And yours are?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Possibly.\\n\\n_INT.

I haven\\'t seen her since I was little.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Dreams pass in time.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\'d rather dream of PADME. Just Being around her again is intoxicating.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You\\'ve made a commitment to the Jedi order a commitment not easily broken and don\\'t forget she\\'s a politician. They\\'re not to be trusted.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : She\\'s not like the others in the Senate, Master.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : It\\'s been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics It\\'s too early in the morning and besides, you\\'re generalizing. The Chancellor doesn\\'t appear to be corrupt.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Palpatine is a politician, I\\'ve observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I think he is a good man.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : I sense it, too.\\n\\n_INT.

Pull up, Anakin. Pull up! You know I don\\'t like it when you do that.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Sorry, I forgot you don\\'t like flying, Master.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : I don\\'t mind flying but what you\\'re doing is suicide! It\\'s dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Where are you going? He went down there, the other way.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working for.

Well, you lost him.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m deeply sorry, Master.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way.

His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are.

It\\'s impossible to deny you\\'ve that you\\'ve grown up.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. Don\\'t get me wrong Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only although I\\'m a Padawan learner, in some ways a lot of ways I\\'m ahead of him. I\\'m ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I\\'m too unpredictable Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it I know I started my training late but he won\\'t let me move on.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : That must be frustrating.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : It\\'s worse he\\'s overly critical.

What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : Kamino Kyberdart I wonder why it didn\\'t show up in any analysis archive.\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : It\\'s these funny little cuts on the side give it away Those analysis droids you\\'ve got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn\\'t be here, would we? Kamino doesn\\'t sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : No, it\\'s beyond the Outer Rim. I\\'d say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They\\'re cloners. Damned good ones, too.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : Cloners?

Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi\\'s life, so you might say we\\'re encouraged to love.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : You have changed so much\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : You haven\\'t changed a bit.

Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. How embarrassing. How embarrassing! Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds and find Obi-Wan\\'s wayward planet we will.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : This is where it ought to be but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here but there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\n- **YODA** to **CHILDREN** : Most interesting. Gravity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?\\n- **CHILDREN** to **YODA** : Because someone erased it from the archive memory.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. The data must have been erased.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files.

The separatists don\\'t have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I\\'m sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.\\n- **BIBBLE** to **QUEEN JAMILLIA** : It\\'s outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, NUTE is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?\\n- **QUEEN JAMILLIA** to **PADME** : We must keep our faith in the Republic.

Now we can do it in half the time.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : I see.\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : Who was the original host?\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : Where is this bounty hunter now?\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he\\'s free to come and go as he pleases.\\n\\n_INT.

No tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : I would like to meet this Jango Fett.\\n- **TAUN WE** to **OBI-WAN** : I would be most happy to arrange it, for you.\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : Magnificent, aren\\'t they?\\n\\n_EXT.

I don\\'t think the system works.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : How would you have it work?\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what\\'s in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don\\'t wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Then they should be made to.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : By whom?

I will do anything you ask. If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : I can\\'t. We can\\'t. It\\'s just not possible.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Anything\\'s possible. Padme, please listen\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You\\'re studying to become a Jedi Knight. I\\'m a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go regardless of the way we feel about each other.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Then you do feel something!

Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings but I can\\'t.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : I am not going to give into this.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : It wouldn\\'t have to be that way we could keep it a secret.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Then we\\'d be living a lie - one we couldn\\'t keep even if we wanted to.

There appears to be no motive.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army at the request of the senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?\\n- **MACE WINDU** to **OBI-WAN** : No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Bring him here. Question him we will.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him.\\n- **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Blind we are if creation of this clone army we could not see.\\n- **MACE WINDU** to **YODA** : I think it is time we informed the senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.\\n- **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness.

Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins \\n* **ARTOO** to **ANAKIN** : beeps\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : We lost something.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Not to worry, we\\'re still flying half the ship.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Now we\\'re really picking up speed I\\'m going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand we\\'re in the atmosphere \\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Grab that Keep us level.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Steady.

I\\'m not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely \\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, let\\'s be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : All right. But you owe me and not for saving your skin for the tenth time \\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Ninth time that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn\\'t count. I\\'ll see you at the briefing.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **PALPATINE** : Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **MACE WINDU** : Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **PALPATINE** : General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **MACE WINDU** : That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **PALPATINE** : Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.\\n* **BAIL ORGANA** to **ANAKIN** : Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **BAIL ORGANA** : Thank you, Senator Organa.\\n* **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n* **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : It couldn\\'t possibly be as bad as all that.\\n* **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n* **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.\\n\\n*70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON*\\n\\n* **BAIL ORGANA** to **ANAKIN** : The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor\\'s draconian security measures.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **BAIL ORGANA** : I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts The Chancellor is very clear about that.\\n* **BAIL ORGANA** to **ANAKIN** : I\\'ll do everything I can with the Senate.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **BAIL ORGANA** : Excuse me.\\n* **BAIL ORGANA** to **ANAKIN** : Certainly.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you\\'re back.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I missed you, Padme. I\\'ve missed you so.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : There were whispers that you\\'d been killed. I\\'ve been living with unbearable dread.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I\\'m back, I\\'m all right. It feels like we\\'ve been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been If the Chancellor hadn\\'t been kidnapped. I don\\'t think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Wait, not here \\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Yes, here! I\\'m tired of all this deception. I don\\'t care if they know we\\'re married.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, don\\'t say things like that.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Are you all right? You\\'re trembling. What\\'s going on?\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Something wonderful has happened.

I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I know \\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I don\\'t need his help Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.\\n\\n*77 INT.

The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **YODA** : I won\\'t let these visions come true, Master Yoda.\\n* **YODA** to **ANAKIN** : Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **YODA** : What must I do, Master Yoda?\\n* **YODA** to **ANAKIN** : Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\\n\\n*79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY*\\n\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\'m sorry, I was held up.

Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What\\'s wrong then?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Be careful of what?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : He has requested your presence.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What for?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : He would not say.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : He didn\\'t inform the Jedi Council?

I don\\'t understand.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin I\\'m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members.

CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY*\\n\\n* **YODA** to **ANAKIN** : Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **YODA** : I understand.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : What? ! How can you do this? This is outrageous, it\\'s unfair. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : Take a seat, young Skywalker.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : Forgive me, Master.\\n* **KI-ADI** to **MACE WINDU** : We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : It may take some time we do not have many ships to spare.\\n* **KI-ADI** to **YODA** : What about the droid attack on the WOOKIES?\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **KI-ADI** : It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **MACE WINDU** : He\\'s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It\\'s the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Go, I will. Good relations with the WOOKIES, I have.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **YODA** : It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the WOOKIES on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.\\n\\n*84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON*\\n\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!? That\\'s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It\\'s insulting!\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age, it\\'s never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you\\'re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn\\'t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I swear to you, I didn\\'t ask to be put on the Council \\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : But it\\'s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : That has nothing to do with this.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : And?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn\\'t want to see you put in this situation.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What situation?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor\\'s dealings. They want to know what he\\'s up to.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That\\'s treason!\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : We are at war, Anakin.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Why didn\\'t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He\\'s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : You\\'re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend. That\\'s what\\'s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : The Council is asking you.\\n\\n*86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY*\\n\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **OBI-WAN** : It\\'s very dangerous, putting them together. I don\\'t think the boy can handle it. I don\\'t trust him.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **MACE WINDU** : With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **OBI-WAN** : So the prophecy says.\\n* **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : A prophecy that misread could have been.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : He will not let me down. He never has.\\n* **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.\\n\\n*87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET*\\n\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Sometimes, I wonder what\\'s happening to the Jedi Order I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? \\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : What do you mean?\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I don\\'t believe that. And you\\'re sounding like a Separatist!\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen Now, you\\'re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Don\\'t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I\\'m not your errand boy. I\\'m not anyone\\'s errand boy!\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : What is it?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Nothing.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Don\\'t do this don\\'t shut me out.

CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT*\\n\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : You wanted to see me, Chancellor.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : At last, we\\'ll be able to capture that monster and end this war.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn\\'t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far but, they can\\'t always be trusted to do the right thing.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Sit down, Leave us.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, you know I\\'m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven\\'t included you in their plot, they soon will.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I\\'m not sure I understand.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : You must sense what I have come to suspect the Jedi Council want control of the Republic they\\'re planning to betray me.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I don\\'t think \\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don\\'t you?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I know they don\\'t trust you \\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Or the Senate or the Republic or democracy for that matter.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn\\'t they?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : They asked you to spy on me, didn\\'t they?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I don\\'t know I don\\'t know what to say.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : The Jedi use their power for good.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be \\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : evil.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : from a Jedi\\'s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : And the Jedi don\\'t?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : The Jedi are selfless they only care about others.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : No.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I thought not. It\\'s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\\'s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : He could actually save people from death?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : What happened to him?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It\\'s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : Is it possible to learn this power?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Not from a Jedi.\\n\\n*90 INT.

Quickly and decisively we should proceed.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : A Master is needed, with more experience.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **YODA** : Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi Master Kenobi.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Obi-Wan, my choice is.\\n* **KI-ADI** to **OBI-WAN** : I concur.

I have not been very appreciative of your training I have been arrogant and I apologize I\\'ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin.

Don\\'t you wonder why they won\\'t make you a Jedi Master?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : They don\\'t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : How do you know the ways of the Force?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : My mentor taught me everything about the Force even the nature of the dark side.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : You know the dark side?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : What did you say?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Use my knowledge, I beg you \\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : You\\'re a Sith Lord!\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I know what has been troubling you Listen to me.

I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Of course you should. But you\\'re not sure of their intentions, are you?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I will quickly discover the truth of all this.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : You have great wisdom, Anakin.

There is much fear that clouds your judgment.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : I must go, Master.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : Yes, Master.\\n\\n*125 INT.

Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter. very similar to your vaporators. You could say.\\n- **OWEN** to **THREEPIO** : Do you speak Bocce?\\n- **THREEPIO** to **OWEN** : Of course I can, sir. It\\'s like a second language for me. I\\'m as fluent in Bocce.\\n- **OWEN** to **JAWA** : All right shut up! I\\'ll take this one.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **OWEN** : Shutting up, sir.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let\\'s go.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Uncle Owen.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Yeah?\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!\\n- **OWEN** to **JAWA** : Hey, what\\'re you trying to push on us?\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Uncle Owen.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Yeah?\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : What about that one?\\n- **OWEN** to **JAWA** : What about that blue one? We\\'ll take that one.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Uh, I\\'m quite sure you\\'ll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I\\'ve worked with him before. Here he comes.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Okay, let\\'s go.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : Now, don\\'t you forget this!

I\\'m never gonna get out of here!\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Is there anything I might do to help?\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I don\\'t think so, sir. I\\'m only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I\\'m not even sure which planet I\\'m on.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Well, if there\\'s a bright center to the universe, you\\'re on the planet that it\\'s farthest from.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I see, sir.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Uh, you can call me Luke.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I see, sir Luke.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Just Luke.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, ARTOO.\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : Hello.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : With all we\\'ve been through, sometimes I\\'m amazed we\\'re in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : That\\'s how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Have you been in many battles?\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Several, I think. Actually, there\\'s not much to tell. I\\'m not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : Well, my little friend, you\\'ve got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or.\\n- **LEIA** to **OBI-WAN** : Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You\\'re my only hope.\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : What\\'s this?\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : What is what?!? He asked you a question. What is that?\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LEIA** to **OBI-WAN** : Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You\\'re my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You\\'re my only hope.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Oh, he says it\\'s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Who is she? She\\'s beautiful.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I\\'m afraid I\\'m not quite sure, sir.\\n- **LEIA** to **OBI-WAN** : Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to.\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : Is there more to this recording?\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : Behave yourself, ARTOO. You\\'re going to get us in trouble. It\\'s all right, you can trust him. He\\'s our new master.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : He says he\\'s the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it\\'s a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don\\'t know what he\\'s talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we\\'ve been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he\\'s talking about?\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Well, I don\\'t know anyone named Obi-\\n  Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He\\'s kind of a strange old hermit.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : I wonder who she is. It sounds like she\\'s in trouble. I\\'d better play back the whole thing.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : H\\'m? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you\\'re too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : There you go.\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : Well, wait a minute. Where\\'d she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : What message? The one you\\'re carrying inside your rusty innards!\\n- **BERU** to **LUKE** : Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!\\n- **LUKE** to **BERU** : All right, I\\'ll be right there, BERU.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I\\'m sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Well, see what you can do with him. I\\'ll be right back.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : No, I don\\'t think he likes you at all.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : No, I don\\'t like you either.\\n\\n## INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : What makes you think that?\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he\\'s talking about? Well, I wonder if he\\'s related to Ben.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : That old man\\'s just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That\\'ll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : He won\\'t, I don\\'t think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : He knew my father?\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : You mean the next semester before harvest?\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Sure, there\\'re more than enough droids.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we\\'ll make enough on the harvest so I\\'ll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : You must understand I need you here, Luke.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : But it\\'s a whole another year.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Look, it\\'s only one more season.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Yeah, that\\'s what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\\n- **BERU** to **LUKE** : Where are you going?\\n- **LUKE** to **BERU** : It looks like I\\'m going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.\\n- **BERU** to **OWEN** : Owen, he can\\'t stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : I\\'ll make it up to him next year. I promise.\\n- **BERU** to **OWEN** : Luke\\'s just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : That\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.\\n\\n## INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : What are you doing hiding there?\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : It wasn\\'t my fault, sir. Please don\\'t deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he\\'s faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Oh, no!\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\\n\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can\\'t understand their logic at times.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : How could I be so stupid? He\\'s nowhere in sight. Blast it!\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Pardon me, sir, but couldn\\'t we go after him?\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : It\\'s too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We\\'ll have to wait until morning.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Luke, I\\'m shutting the power down for the night.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : All right, I\\'ll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Oh, he excels at that, sir.\\n\\n## INT.

LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN\\n\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : Have you seen Luke this morning?\\n- **BERU** to **OWEN** : He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?\\n- **BERU** to **OWEN** : I think so.\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : Well, he\\'d better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there\\'ll be hell to pay!\\n\\n## INT./EXT.

We\\'ll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish. and don\\'t talk to me about your mission, either. You\\'re fortunate he doesn\\'t blast you into a million pieces right here.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Well, come on. It\\'s getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : What\\'s wrong with him now?\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Oh my. sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let\\'s have a look. Come on.\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DA\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : There are two Banthas down there but I don\\'t see any. wait a second, they\\'re Sandpeople all right.

You\\'re fortunate you\\'re still in one piece.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Oh, this little droid! I think he\\'s searching for his former master. I\\'ve never seen such devotion in a droid before. there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he\\'s talking about?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven\\'t heard in a long time. a long time.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Oh, he\\'s not dead, not. not yet.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You know him!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Well of course, of course I know him. He\\'s me! I haven\\'t gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\\n- **ARTOO** to **OBI-WAN** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Then the droid does belong to you.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Don\\'t seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\\n- **ARTOO** to **LUKE** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : Threepio!\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY\\n\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Can you stand? We\\'ve got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I don\\'t think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There\\'s no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I\\'m done for.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : No, you\\'re not. What kind of talk is that?\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Quickly, son. they\\'re on the move.\\n\\n## INT. KENOBI\\'S DWELLING\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : No, my father didn\\'t fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : That\\'s what your uncle told you. He didn\\'t hold with your father\\'s ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You fought in the Clone Wars?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I wish I\\'d known him.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you\\'ve become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn\\'t allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Sir, if you\\'ll not be needing me, I\\'ll close down for awhile.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Sure, go ahead.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : What is it?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : How did my father die?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : The Force?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It\\'s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.\\n- **ARTOO** to **OBI-WAN** : beeps\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ARTOO** : Now, let\\'s see if we can\\'t figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I saw part of the message he was.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I seem to have found it.\\n- **LEIA** to **OBI-WAN** : General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father\\'s request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I\\'m afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you\\'re my only hope.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You must learn the ways of the Force if you\\'re to come with me to Alderaan.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Alderaan? I\\'m not going to Alderaan. I\\'ve got to go home. It\\'s late, I\\'m in for it as it is.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I\\'m getting too old for this sort of thing.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I can\\'t get involved! I\\'ve got work to do! It\\'s not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there\\'s nothing I can do about it right now. It\\'s such a long way from here.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : That\\'s your uncle talking.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Learn about the Force, Luke.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you\\'re going.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You must do what you feel is right, of course.\\n\\n## INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\\n\\n- **TAGGE** to **MOTTI** : Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They\\'re more dangerous than you realize.\\n- **MOTTI** to **TAGGE** : Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!\\n- **TAGGE** to **MOTTI** : The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.\\n- **TARKIN** to **TAGGE** : The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I\\'ve just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.\\n- **TAGGE** to **TARKIN** : That\\'s impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\\n- **TARKIN** to **TAGGE** : The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.\\n- **TAGGE** to **TARKIN** : And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **TAGGE** : The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.\\n- **MOTTI** to **DARTH VADER** : Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they\\'ve obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **MOTTI** : Don\\'t be too proud of this technological terror you\\'ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\\n- **MOTTI** to **DARTH VADER** : Don\\'t try to frighten us with your sorcerer\\'s ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel\\'s hidden fort.\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **MOTTI** : I find your lack of faith disturbing.\\n- **TARKIN** to **DARTH VADER** : Enough of this! Vader, release him!\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **TARKIN** : As you wish.\\n- **TARKIN** to **DARTH VADER** : This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It\\'s just. I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : They didn\\'t. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : These are the same Jawas that sold us ARTOO and Threepio.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Wait, Luke! It\\'s too dangerous.\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Uncle Owen! BERU!

You\\'d have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I want to come with you to Alderaan. There\\'s nothing here for me now.

If only you hadn\\'t had to dump that shipment of spice. you understand I just can\\'t make an exception.

So, for an extra, say twenty percent I\\'ll give you a little more time. but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I\\'ll put a price on your head so large you won\\'t be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **JABBA** : Jabba, I\\'ll pay you because it\\'s my pleasure.\\n\\n## INT.

You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It\\'s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\\n- **DODONNA** to **PILOTS** : Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you\\'ll have to use proton torpedoes.\\n- **WEDGE** to **LUKE** : That\\'s impossible, even for a computer.\\n- **LUKE** to **WEDGE** : It\\'s not impossible. I used to bull\\'s- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They\\'re not much bigger than two meters.\\n- **DODONNA** to **PILOTS** : Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!\\n\\n## INT.

You\\'re pretty good in a fight. I could use you.\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : Come on! Why don\\'t you take a look around? You know what\\'s about to happen, what they\\'re up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You\\'re turning your back on them.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : What good\\'s a reward if you ain\\'t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain\\'t my idea of courage. It\\'s more like suicide.\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han.

And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **EMPEROR** : Yes, my Master.\\n- **EMPEROR** to **DARTH VADER** : Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **EMPEROR** : As you wish.\\n- **EMPEROR** to **DARTH VADER** : Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\\n\\n## 50 INT YODA\\'S HOUSE\\n\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Hmm.

Earned it, I have.\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : Master Yoda, you can\\'t die.\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Strong am I with the Force. but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things. the way of the Force.\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : But I need your help. I\\'ve come back to complete the training.\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : Then I am a Jedi?\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : Master Yoda. is Darth Vader my father?\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Mmm. rest I need. Yes. rest.\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : Yoda, I must know.\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Your father he is.\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : told you, did he?\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : Yes.\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : Unfortunate that I know the truth?\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him. that incomplete was your training. Not\\n  ready for the burden were you.\\n- **LUKE** to **YODA** : Well, I\\'m sorry.\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Remember, a Jedi\\'s strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.\\n- **YODA** to **LUKE** : Luke.Luke.Do not.Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father\\'s fate, you will.

I can\\'t go on alone.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Yoda will always be with you.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Obi-Wan! Why didn\\'t you tell me?\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true. from a certain point of view.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : A certain point of view!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Luke, you\\'re going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I don\\'t blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn\\'t have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Anakin was a good friend.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : There\\'s still good in him.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn\\'t be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I can\\'t do it, Ben.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You cannot escape your destiny.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I tried to stop him once. I couldn\\'t do it.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke. but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : But I had to help my friends.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I found out Darth Vader was my father.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : to be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn\\'t get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You\\'re no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I can\\'t kill my own father.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Yoda spoke of another.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : The other he spoke of is your twin sister.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : But I have no sister.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Hmm. to protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Leia! Leia\\'s my sister.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : When your father left, he didn\\'t know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine. and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage. no one knew she\\'d been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father\\'s path, became a senator as well. That\\'s not all she became, of course. she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That\\'s what she was doing when her path crossed yours. for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : But you can\\'t let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : She hasn\\'t been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke. but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!\\n\\n## 53 INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\\n\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : Well, look at you, a general, huh?\\n- **LANDO** to **HAN SOLO** : Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : Well, don\\'t look at me, pal.

We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we\\'ve learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.\\n- **CHEWBACCA** to **HAN SOLO** : BARKS\\n- **MON MOTHMA** to **REBEL PILOTS** : Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\\n- **ACKBAR** to **REBEL PILOTS** : You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\\n- **ACKBAR** to **REBEL PILOTS** : General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : Good luck.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : You\\'re gonna need it.\\n- **ACKBAR** to **GENERAL MADINE** : General Madine.\\n- **GENERAL MADINE** to **REBEL PILOTS** : We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.

That's not all she became, of course. she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire.

Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.\\n PADME to PANAKA : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, PANAKA will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless.\\n QUI-GON to PADME : A well-conceived plan. However, there\\'s great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.\\n OBI-WAN to PADME : And there\\'s an even bigger danger.

Pull up, Anakin. Pull up! You know I don\\'t like it when you do that.\\n- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Sorry, I forgot you don\\'t like flying, Master.\\n- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : I don\\'t mind flying but what you\\'re doing is suicide! It\\'s dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Where are you going? He went down there, the other way.\\n- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he s working for. This is a shortcut I think.\\n- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Oh, so that s why we re going in the wrong direction. Well, you lost him.\\n- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I m deeply sorry, Master.\\n- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way.

His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.\\n- YODA to OBI-WAN : Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are.

It\\'s impossible to deny you\\'ve that you\\'ve grown up.\\n- ANAKIN to PADME : Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. Don\\'t get me wrong Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only although I\\'m a Padawan learner, in some ways a lot of ways I\\'m ahead of him.

He believes I\\'m too unpredictable Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it I know I started my training late but he won\\'t let me move on.\\n- PADME to ANAKIN : That must be frustrating.\\n- ANAKIN to PADME : It\\'s worse he\\'s overly critical.

What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.\\n- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Kamino Kyberdart I wonder why it didn\\'t show up in any analysis archive.\\n- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : It\\'s these funny little cuts on the side give it away Those analysis droids you\\'ve got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.\\n- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn\\'t be here, would we? Kamino doesn\\'t sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?\\n- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : No, it\\'s beyond the Outer Rim. I\\'d say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They\\'re cloners. Damned good ones, too.\\n- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Cloners? Are they friendly?\\n- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : It depends.\\n- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : On what, Dex?\\n- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : On how good your manners are and how big your pocketbook is.\\n\\n_INT.

Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?\\n- OBI-WAN to JOCASTA NU : According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere just south of the Rishi Maze.\\n- JOCASTA NU to OBI-WAN : It ought to be. Unless it was very recent. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you\\'re searching for doesn\\'t exist.

Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi\\'s life, so you might say we\\'re encouraged to love.\\n- PADME to ANAKIN : You have changed so much\\n- ANAKIN to PADME : You haven\\'t changed a bit.

How embarrassing. How embarrassing! Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds and find Obi-Wan\\'s wayward planet we will.\\n- OBI-WAN to YODA : This is where it ought to be but it isn t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here but there isn t.\\n- YODA to CHILDREN : Most interesting. Gravity s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?\\n- CHILDREN to YODA : Because someone erased it from the archive memory.\\n- YODA to OBI-WAN : Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. The data must have been erased.\\n- OBI-WAN to YODA : But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That s impossible, isn t it?\\n- YODA to OBI-WAN : Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer.

There hasn\\'t been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.\\n- QUEEN JAMILLIA to PADME : Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?\\n- PADME to QUEEN JAMILLIA : Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don\\'t have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I\\'m sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.\\n- BIBBLE to QUEEN JAMILLIA : It\\'s outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, NUTE is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?\\n- QUEEN JAMILLIA to PADME : We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.\\n- PADME to QUEEN JAMILLIA : Let\\'s pray that day never comes.\\n- QUEEN JAMILLIA to PADME : In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.\\n- BIBBLE to PADME : What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?\\n- PADME to BIBBLE : Anakin\\'s not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He\\'s still a Padawan learner. I was thinking\\n- ANAKIN to PADME : Hey, hold on a minute!\\n- PADME to ANAKIN : Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country.

We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago.\\n- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : You mentioned growth acceleration.\\n- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Oh, yes, it\\'s essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time.\\n- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : I see.\\n- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.\\n- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Who was the original host?\\n- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.\\n- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Where is this bounty hunter now?\\n- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he\\'s free to come and go as he pleases.\\n\\n_INT.

No tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration\\n- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : I would like to meet this Jango Fett.\\n- TAUN WE to OBI-WAN : I would be most happy to arrange it, for you.\\n- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Magnificent, aren\\'t they?\\n\\n_EXT.

I don\\'t think the system works.\\n- PADME to ANAKIN : How would you have it work?\\n- ANAKIN to PADME : We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what\\'s in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.\\n- PADME to ANAKIN : That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don\\'t wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.\\n- ANAKIN to PADME : Then they should be made to.\\n- PADME to ANAKIN : By whom?

They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we are looking for.\\n- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?\\n- OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : No, Master. There appears to be no motive.\\n- YODA to OBI-WAN : Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.\\n- OBI-WAN to YODA : Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army at the request of the senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?\\n- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.\\n- YODA to OBI-WAN : Bring him here. Question him we will.\\n- OBI-WAN to YODA : Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him.\\n- YODA to MACE WINDU : Blind we are if creation of this clone army we could not see.\\n- MACE WINDU to YODA : I think it is time we informed the senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.\\n- YODA to MACE WINDU : Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness.

He is escorting Senator PADME home. I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.\\n- YODA to OBI-WAN : Victory? Victory, you say? Not victory, a defeat, it was Master Obi-Wan.

I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely \\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, let\\'s be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : All right.

I\\'ll see you at the briefing.\\n MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?\\n PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.\\n MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.\\n PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.\\n MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.\\n BAIL ORGANA to ANAKIN : Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.\\n ANAKIN to BAIL ORGANA : Thank you, Senator Organa.\\n ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n THREEPIO to ARTOO : It couldn\\'t possibly be as bad as all that.\\n ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n THREEPIO to ARTOO : Well, there, I agree with you.

I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : I know .\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?\\n ANAKIN to PADME : I don\\'t need his help Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.\\n\\n 77 INT.

The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.\\n ANAKIN to YODA : I won\\'t let these visions come true, Master Yoda.\\n YODA to ANAKIN : Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy.

Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What\\'s wrong then?\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Be careful of what?\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : He has requested your presence.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What for?\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : He would not say.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : He didn\\'t inform the Jedi Council?

How can you do this? This is outrageous, it\\'s unfair. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Take a seat, young Skywalker.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Forgive me, Master.\\n KI-ADI to MACE WINDU : We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.\\n YODA to MACE WINDU : Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.\\n OBI-WAN to YODA : It may take some time we do not have many ships to spare.\\n KI-ADI to YODA : What about the droid attack on the WOOKIES?\\n MACE WINDU to KI-ADI : It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!\\n OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : He\\'s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It\\'s the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.\\n YODA to MACE WINDU : Go, I will. Good relations with the WOOKIES, I have.\\n MACE WINDU to YODA : It is settled then.

That\\'s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It\\'s insulting!\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age, it\\'s never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you\\'re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn\\'t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I swear to you, I didn\\'t ask to be put on the Council \\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : But it\\'s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : That has nothing to do with this.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : And?\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn\\'t want to see you put in this situation.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What situation?\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor\\'s dealings. They want to know what he\\'s up to.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That\\'s treason!\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : We are at war, Anakin.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Why didn\\'t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He\\'s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : You\\'re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend. That\\'s what\\'s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : The Council is asking you.\\n\\n 86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY \\n\\n OBI-WAN to YODA : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.\\n MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : It\\'s very dangerous, putting them together. I don\\'t think the boy can handle it. I don\\'t trust him.\\n OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?\\n MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : So the prophecy says.\\n YODA to OBI-WAN : A prophecy that misread could have been.\\n OBI-WAN to YODA : He will not let me down. He never has.\\n YODA to OBI-WAN : I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.\\n\\n 87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET \\n\\n ANAKIN to PADME : Sometimes, I wonder what\\'s happening to the Jedi Order I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? \\n ANAKIN to PADME : What do you mean?\\n PADME to ANAKIN : What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?\\n ANAKIN to PADME : I don\\'t believe that. And you\\'re sounding like a Separatist!\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen Now, you\\'re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : Don\\'t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I\\'m not your errand boy. I\\'m not anyone\\'s errand boy!\\n PADME to ANAKIN : What is it?\\n ANAKIN to PADME : Nothing.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Don\\'t do this don\\'t shut me out. Let me help you.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago when there was nothing but our love No politics, no plotting no war.\\n\\n 88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT \\n\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You wanted to see me, Chancellor.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : At last, we\\'ll be able to capture that monster and end this war.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn\\'t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far but, they can\\'t always be trusted to do the right thing.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Sit down, Leave us.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin, you know I\\'m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven\\'t included you in their plot, they soon will.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I\\'m not sure I understand.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You must sense what I have come to suspect the Jedi Council want control of the Republic they\\'re planning to betray me.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I don\\'t think \\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don\\'t you?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I know they don\\'t trust you \\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Or the Senate or the Republic or democracy for that matter.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn\\'t they?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : They asked you to spy on me, didn\\'t they?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I don\\'t know I don\\'t know what to say.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : The Jedi use their power for good.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be \\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : evil.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : from a Jedi\\'s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : And the Jedi don\\'t?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : The Jedi are selfless they only care about others.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : No.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I thought not. It\\'s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\\'s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : He could actually save people from death?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What happened to him?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It\\'s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Is it possible to learn this power?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Not from a Jedi.\\n\\n 90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY \\n\\n KI-ADI to YODA : Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.\\n ANAKIN to YODA : A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.\\n YODA to ANAKIN : Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.\\n YODA to MACE WINDU : A Master is needed, with more experience.\\n MACE WINDU to YODA : Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi Master Kenobi.\\n YODA to MACE WINDU : Obi-Wan, my choice is.\\n KI-ADI to OBI-WAN : I concur. Master Kenobi should go.\\n YODA to OBI-WAN : I agree.\\n MACE WINDU to YODA : Very well. Council is adjourned.\\n\\n 91 INT.

CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \\n\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : You\\'re going to need me on this one, Master.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Master! Master, I\\'ve disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training I have been arrogant and I apologize I\\'ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won\\'t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.\\n ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.\\n OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.\\n\\n 98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE \\n\\n CLONE COMMANDER CODY to OBI-WAN : Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here on the far side.\\n OBI-WAN to CLONE COMMANDER CODY : I\\'ll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don\\'t take too long.\\n CLONE COMMANDER CODY to OBI-WAN : Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?\\n OBI-WAN to CLONE COMMANDER CODY : Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.\\n CLONE COMMANDER CODY to OBI-WAN : I\\'m counting on you.\\n\\n 102 INT.

He says you\\'re under a lot of stress.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : And he\\'s not?\\n PADME to ANAKIN : You have been moody lately.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : I\\'m not moody \\n PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin! Don\\'t do this again.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : I don\\'t know I feel lost.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Lost? What do you mean? You\\'re always so sure of yourself. I don\\'t understand.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : Obi-Wan and the Council don\\'t trust me.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : Something\\'s happening I\\'m not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I\\'m not satisfied I want more, and I know I shouldn\\'t.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : You expect too much of yourself.\\n ANAKIN to PADME : I have found a way to save you.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Save me?\\n ANAKIN to PADME : From my nightmares.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : Is that what\\'s bothering you?\\n ANAKIN to PADME : I won\\'t lose you, Padme.\\n PADME to ANAKIN : I\\'m not going to die in childbirth, Annie.

We are being held hostage. They are watching us.\\n OBI-WAN to TION MEDON : I understand.\\n TION MEDON to OBI-WAN : The tenth level thousands of Battle Droids \\n OBI-WAN to TION MEDON : Tell your people to take shelter.

UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY \\n\\n GENERAL GRIEVOUS to NUTE GUNRAY : It won\\'t be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.\\n NUTE GUNRAY to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.\\n GENERAL GRIEVOUS to NUTE GUNRAY : Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip Your ship is waiting.\\n\\n 112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY \\n\\n OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Hello, there!\\n GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : General Kenobi, you are a bold one.

I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.\\n OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Your move.\\n GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.\\n OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!\\n OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.\\n GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.\\n OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n 117 INT.

General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.\\n MACE WINDU to CLONE COMMANDER CODY : Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his\\nintentions.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Yes, Master.\\n MACE WINDU to KI-ADI : I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.\\n KI-ADI to MACE WINDU : If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.\\n MACE WINDU to KI-ADI : That could be a dangerous move the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition.\\n YODA to MACE WINDU : To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Great care we must take.\\n\\n 118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING \\n\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I should be there with him.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn\\'t seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don\\'t you wonder why they won\\'t make you a Jedi Master?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : They don\\'t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : How do you know the ways of the Force?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : My mentor taught me everything about the Force even the nature of the dark side.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You know the dark side?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What did you say?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Use my knowledge, I beg you \\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You\\'re a Sith Lord!\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I know what has been troubling you Listen to me. Don\\'t continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I\\'ve known you, you\\'ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi a life of significance, of conscience.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You\\'re wrong!\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Are you going to kill me?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I would certainly like to.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Of course you should. But you\\'re not sure of their intentions, are you?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I will quickly discover the truth of all this.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side the power to save Padme.\\n\\n 124 INT.

We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : He won\\'t give up his power. I\\'ve just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : A Sith Lord?\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Yes. The one we have been looking for.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : How do you know this?\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Are you sure?\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Absolutely.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : I must go, Master.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Yes, Master.\\n\\n 125 INT.

I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.\\n MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return.

You will die!\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : He is a traitor, Anakin.\\n MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : He\\'s the traitor. Stop him!\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You are not one of them, Anakin. Don\\'t let him kill me.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Don\\'t listen to him, Anakin.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Help me! Don\\'t let him kill me.

I can\\'t hold on any longer.\\n MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : You can\\'t kill him, Master. He must stand trial.\\n MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.\\n PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : I\\'m too weak. Don\\'t kill me. Please.\\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : It is not the Jedi way \\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : He must live \\n PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Please don\\'t, please don\\'t \\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : I need him \\n PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Please don\\'t \\n ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : NO!\\n PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Power!

The Jedi\\'s next move will be against the Senate.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don\\'t you?\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I understand, Master.\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.\\n ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?\\n PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Their betrayal will be dealt with.

Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter. very similar to your vaporators. You could say.\\n- OWEN to THREEPIO : Do you speak Bocce?\\n- THREEPIO to OWEN : Of course I can, sir. It\\'s like a second language for me. I\\'m as fluent in Bocce.\\n- OWEN to JAWA : All right shut up! I\\'ll take this one.\\n- THREEPIO to OWEN : Shutting up, sir.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!\\n- LUKE to OWEN : All right, come on! And the red one, come on.

We\\'ll take that one.\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : Uh, I\\'m quite sure you\\'ll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I\\'ve worked with him before.

I\\'m only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways.

What is that?\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- LEIA to OBI-WAN : Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You\\'re my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You\\'re my only hope.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : Oh, he says it\\'s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : Who is she?

A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to.\\n- LUKE to ARTOO : Is there more to this recording?\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Behave yourself, ARTOO. You\\'re going to get us in trouble. It\\'s all right, you can trust him. He\\'s our new master.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : He says he\\'s the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it\\'s a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don\\'t know what he\\'s talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we\\'ve been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he\\'s talking about?\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : Well, I don\\'t know anyone named Obi-\\n Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He\\'s kind of a strange old hermit.\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : I wonder who she is. It sounds like she\\'s in trouble. I\\'d better play back the whole thing.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : H\\'m? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you\\'re too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.\\n- LUKE to ARTOO : There you go.\\n- LUKE to ARTOO : Well, wait a minute. Where\\'d she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- THREEPIO to ARTOO : What message? The one you\\'re carrying inside your rusty innards!\\n- BERU to LUKE : Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!\\n- LUKE to BERU : All right, I\\'ll be right there, BERU.\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : I\\'m sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : Well, see what you can do with him. I\\'ll be right back.\\n- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- THREEPIO to ARTOO : No, I don\\'t think he likes you at all.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- THREEPIO to ARTOO : No, I don\\'t like you either.\\n\\n INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA\\n\\n- LUKE to OWEN : You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : What makes you think that?\\n- LUKE to OWEN : Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he\\'s talking about? Well, I wonder if he\\'s related to Ben.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : That old man\\'s just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That\\'ll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?\\n- OWEN to LUKE : He won\\'t, I don\\'t think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : He knew my father?\\n- OWEN to LUKE : I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : You mean the next semester before harvest?\\n- LUKE to OWEN : Sure, there\\'re more than enough droids.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we\\'ll make enough on the harvest so I\\'ll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : You must understand I need you here, Luke.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : But it\\'s a whole another year.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : Look, it\\'s only one more season.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : Yeah, that\\'s what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\\n- BERU to LUKE : Where are you going?\\n- LUKE to BERU : It looks like I\\'m going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.\\n- BERU to OWEN : Owen, he can\\'t stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.\\n- OWEN to BERU : I\\'ll make it up to him next year. I promise.\\n- BERU to OWEN : Luke\\'s just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.\\n- OWEN to BERU : That\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.\\n\\n INT.

Blast it!\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : Pardon me, sir, but couldn\\'t we go after him?\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : It\\'s too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We\\'ll have to wait until morning.\\n- OWEN to LUKE : Luke, I\\'m shutting the power down for the night.\\n- LUKE to OWEN : All right, I\\'ll be there in a few minutes.

You\\'re fortunate you\\'re still in one piece.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Oh, this little droid! I think he\\'s searching for his former master. I\\'ve never seen such devotion in a droid before. there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he\\'s talking about?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven\\'t heard in a long time. a long time.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Oh, he\\'s not dead, not. not yet.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You know him!\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Well of course, of course I know him. He\\'s me! I haven\\'t gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\\n- ARTOO to OBI-WAN : beeps\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Then the droid does belong to you.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Don\\'t seem to remember ever owning a droid.

We\\'ve got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : I don\\'t think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There\\'s no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I\\'m done for.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : No, you\\'re not.

KENOBI\\'S DWELLING\\n\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : No, my father didn\\'t fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : That\\'s what your uncle told you. He didn\\'t hold with your father\\'s ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You fought in the Clone Wars?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I wish I\\'d known him.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you\\'ve become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn\\'t allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.\\n- THREEPIO to LUKE : Sir, if you\\'ll not be needing me, I\\'ll close down for awhile.\\n- LUKE to THREEPIO : Sure, go ahead.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : What is it?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : How did my father die?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : The Force?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It\\'s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.\\n- ARTOO to OBI-WAN : beeps\\n- OBI-WAN to ARTOO : Now, let\\'s see if we can\\'t figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I saw part of the message he was.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I seem to have found it.\\n- LEIA to OBI-WAN : General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father\\'s request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I\\'m afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you\\'re my only hope.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You must learn the ways of the Force if you\\'re to come with me to Alderaan.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Alderaan? I\\'m not going to Alderaan. I\\'ve got to go home. It\\'s late, I\\'m in for it as it is.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I\\'m getting too old for this sort of thing.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I can\\'t get involved! I\\'ve got work to do! It\\'s not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there\\'s nothing I can do about it right now. It\\'s such a long way from here.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : That\\'s your uncle talking.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Learn about the Force, Luke.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you\\'re going.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You must do what you feel is right, of course.\\n\\n INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\\n\\n- TAGGE to MOTTI : Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They\\'re more dangerous than you realize.\\n- MOTTI to TAGGE : Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!\\n- TAGGE to MOTTI : The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.\\n- TARKIN to TAGGE : The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I\\'ve just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.\\n- TAGGE to TARKIN : That\\'s impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\\n- TARKIN to TAGGE : The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.\\n- TAGGE to TARKIN : And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.\\n- DARTH VADER to TAGGE : The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.\\n- MOTTI to DARTH VADER : Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they\\'ve obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!\\n- DARTH VADER to MOTTI : Don\\'t be too proud of this technological terror you\\'ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\\n- MOTTI to DARTH VADER : Don\\'t try to frighten us with your sorcerer\\'s ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel\\'s hidden fort.\\n- DARTH VADER to MOTTI : I find your lack of faith disturbing.\\n- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : Enough of this! Vader, release him!\\n- DARTH VADER to TARKIN : As you wish.\\n- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\\n\\n EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND\\n\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It\\'s just. I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : They didn\\'t. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : These are the same Jawas that sold us ARTOO and Threepio.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Wait, Luke! It\\'s too dangerous.\\n\\n EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\\n\\n- LUKE to OWEN : Uncle Owen! BERU! Uncle Owen!\\n\\n INT.

I\\'m talking about the big Corellian ships now. She\\'s fast enough for you, old man. What\\'s the cargo?\\n- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : What is it? Some kind of local trouble?\\n- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : Let\\'s just say we\\'d like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Well, that\\'s the trick, isn\\'t it? And it\\'s going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.\\n- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : But who\\'s going to fly it, kid! You?\\n- LUKE to HAN SOLO : You bet I could. I\\'m not such a bad pilot myself! We don\\'t have to sit here and listen.\\n- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : We haven\\'t that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Seventeen, huh!\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We\\'ll leave as soon as you\\'re ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.\\n- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : Ninety-four.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Looks like somebody\\'s beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.\\n- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : barks\\n- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.\\n\\n EXT.

MOS EISLEY - CANTINA\\n\\n- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : Going somewhere, Solo?\\n- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I\\'ve got his money.\\n- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : It\\'s too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba\\'s put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I\\'m lucky I found you first.\\n- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Yeah, but this time I got the money.\\n- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.\\n- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : I don\\'t have it with me. Tell Jabba.\\n- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : Jabba\\'s through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\\n- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?\\n- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.\\n- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Over my dead body.\\n- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : That\\'s the idea. I\\'ve been looking forward to killing you for a long time.\\n- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Yes, I\\'ll bet you have.\\n- HAN SOLO to BARTENDER : Sorry about the mess.\\n\\n INT.

It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.\\n- MOTTI to DARTH VADER : The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?\\n- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.\\n- DARTH VADER to TARKIN : What do you mean?\\n- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia\\'s home planet of Alderaan.\\n- TROOPER to TARKIN : With pleasure.\\n\\n EXT.

And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that. after all we\\'ve been through together.\\n- HAN SOLO to JABBA : You sent Greedo to blast me.\\n- JABBA to HAN SOLO : Han, why you\\'re the best smuggler in the business. You\\'re too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn\\'t going to blast you.\\n- HAN SOLO to JABBA : I think he thought he was. Next time don\\'t send one of those twerps. If you\\'ve got something to say to me, come see me yourself.\\n- JABBA to HAN SOLO : Han, Han! If only you hadn\\'t had to dump that shipment of spice. you understand I just can\\'t make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It\\'s not good business.\\n- HAN SOLO to JABBA : You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I\\'ve got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.\\n- JABBA to HAN SOLO : Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I\\'m only doing this because you\\'re the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I\\'ll give you a little more time. but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I\\'ll put a price on your head so large you won\\'t be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\\n- HAN SOLO to JABBA : Jabba, I\\'ll pay you because it\\'s my pleasure.\\n\\n INT.

She may not look like much, but she\\'s got it where it counts, kid.

I thought you said this thing was fast.\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Watch your mouth, kid, or you\\'re going to find yourself floating home. We\\'ll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We\\'ll lose them!\\n\\n INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Here\\'s where the fun begins!\\n- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : How long before you can make the jump to light speed?\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : It\\'ll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.\\n- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Are you kidding? At the rate they\\'re gaining.\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Traveling through hyperspace isn\\'t like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that\\'d end your trip real quick, wouldn\\'t it?\\n- LUKE to HAN SOLO : What\\'s that flashing?\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : We\\'re losing our deflector shield.

I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\\n- TARKIN to LEIA : Charming to the last. You don\\'t know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\\n- LEIA to TARKIN : I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!\\n- TARKIN to LEIA : Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\\n- LEIA to TARKIN : The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\\n- TARKIN to LEIA : Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that\\'ll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station\\'s destructive power, on your home planet of Alderaan.\\n- LEIA to TARKIN : No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can\\'t possibly.\\n- TARKIN to LEIA : You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!\\n- TARKIN to LEIA : I grow tired of asking this. So it\\'ll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?\\n- LEIA to TARKIN : Dantooine.\\n- LEIA to TARKIN : They\\'re on Dantooine.\\n- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.\\n- LEIA to TARKIN : What?\\n- TARKIN to LEIA : You\\'re far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don\\'t worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.\\n- LEIA to TARKIN : No!\\n\\n INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA\\n\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Are you all right?

I fear something terrible has happened.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You\\'d better get on with your exercises.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I\\'d outrun \\'em.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Don\\'t everyone thank me at once.\\n- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.\\n- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Now be careful, ARTOO.\\n- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps\\n- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks\\n- THREEPIO to CHEWBACCA : He made a fair move. Screaming about it won\\'t help you.\\n- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks\\n- HAN SOLO to THREEPIO : Let him have it. It\\'s not wise to upset a Wookiee.\\n- THREEPIO to HAN SOLO : But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\\n- HAN SOLO to THREEPIO : That\\'s \\'cause droids don\\'t pull people\\'s arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.\\n- THREEPIO to ARTOO : I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, ARTOO. Let the Wookiee win.\\n- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You mean it controls your actions?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Partially. But it also obeys your commands.\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\\n- LUKE to HAN SOLO : You don\\'t believe in the Force, do you?\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Kid, I\\'ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I\\'ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I\\'ve never seen anything to make me believe there\\'s one all-powerful force controlling everything. There\\'s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.\\n- HAN SOLO to LUKE : It\\'s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I suggest you try it again, Luke.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : With the blast shield down, I can\\'t even see. How am I supposed to fight?\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Your eyes can deceive you. Don\\'t trust them.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Stretch out with your feelings.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You see, you can do it.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : I call it luck.\\n- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : In my experience, there\\'s no such thing as luck.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That\\'s something else.\\n- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Looks like we\\'re coming up on Alderaan.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You know, I did feel something.

MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA\\n\\n- DODONNA to PILOTS : The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It\\'s defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.\\n- GOLD LEADER to DODONNA : Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\\n- DODONNA to PILOTS : Well, the Empire doesn\\'t consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they\\'d have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.\\n- DODONNA to PILOTS : The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It\\'s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\\n- DODONNA to PILOTS : Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you\\'ll have to use proton torpedoes.\\n- WEDGE to LUKE : That\\'s impossible, even for a computer.\\n- LUKE to WEDGE : It\\'s not impossible.

That is the way of things. the way of the Force.\\n- LUKE to YODA : But I need your help. I\\'ve come back to complete the training.\\n- YODA to LUKE : No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\\n- LUKE to YODA : Then I am a Jedi?\\n- YODA to LUKE : Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be.

Yes. rest.\\n- LUKE to YODA : Yoda, I must know.\\n- YODA to LUKE : Your father he is.\\n- YODA to LUKE : told you, did he?\\n- LUKE to YODA : Yes.\\n- YODA to LUKE : Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.\\n- LUKE to YODA : Unfortunate that I know the truth?\\n- YODA to LUKE : No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him. that incomplete was your training. Not\\n ready for the burden were you.\\n- LUKE to YODA : Well, I\\'m sorry.\\n- YODA to LUKE : Remember, a Jedi\\'s strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression.

I can\\'t go on alone.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Yoda will always be with you.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Obi-Wan! Why didn\\'t you tell me?\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true. from a certain point of view.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : A certain point of view!\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Luke, you\\'re going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I don\\'t blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn\\'t have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Anakin was a good friend.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : There\\'s still good in him.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn\\'t be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I can\\'t do it, Ben.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You cannot escape your destiny.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I tried to stop him once. I couldn\\'t do it.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke. but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : But I had to help my friends.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I found out Darth Vader was my father.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : to be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn\\'t get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You\\'re no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I can\\'t kill my own father.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Yoda spoke of another.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : The other he spoke of is your twin sister.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : But I have no sister.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Hmm. to protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Leia! Leia\\'s my sister.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : When your father left, he didn\\'t know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine. and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage. no one knew she\\'d been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father\\'s path, became a senator as well. That\\'s not all she became, of course. she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That\\'s what she was doing when her path crossed yours. for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.\\n- LUKE to OBI-WAN : But you can\\'t let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\\n- OBI-WAN to LUKE : She hasn\\'t been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke. but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!\\n\\n 53 INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\\n\\n- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Well, look at you, a general, huh?\\n- LANDO to HAN SOLO : Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.\\n- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Well, don\\'t look at me, pal.

We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we\\'ve learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.\\n- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : BARKS\\n- MON MOTHMA to REBEL PILOTS : Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\\n- ACKBAR to REBEL PILOTS : You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\\n- ACKBAR to REBEL PILOTS : General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\\n- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Good luck.\\n- HAN SOLO to LANDO : You\\'re gonna need it.\\n- ACKBAR to GENERAL MADINE : General Madine.\\n- GENERAL MADINE to REBEL PILOTS : We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.

It won\\'t be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don\\'t make it back, you\\'re the only hope for the Alliance.\\n- LEIA to LUKE : Luke, don\\'t talk that way. You have a power I--I don\\'t understand and could never have.\\n- LUKE to LEIA : You\\'re wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you\\'ll learn to use it as I have.

You\\'ve only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn\\'t driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn\\'t destroy me. That\\'s why you won\\'t bring me to your Emperor now.\\n- DARTH VADER to LUKE : I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\\n- DARTH VADER to LUKE : Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.\\n- LUKE to DARTH VADER : Come with me.\\n- DARTH VADER to LUKE : Obi-Wan once thought as you do.\\n- DARTH VADER to LUKE : You don\\'t know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\\n- LUKE to DARTH VADER : I will not turn.and you\\'ll be forced to kill me.\\n- DARTH VADER to LUKE : If that is your destiny.\\n- LUKE to DARTH VADER : Search your feelings, father. You can\\'t do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.\\n- DARTH VADER to LUKE : It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force.

So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine. and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\n",

But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course. she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.

He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : The council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.\\n- **MACE WINDU** to **OBI-WAN** : The boy has exceptional skills.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **MACE WINDU** : But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.\\n- **MACE WINDU** to **OBI-WAN** : Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.\\n\\n_INT. SENATE BUILDING, PADME\\'S APARTMENT - DAY_\\n\\n- **PADME** to **JAR JAR** : I\\'m taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate. Representative Binks. I know I can count on you.\\n- **JAR JAR** to **PADME** : Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. It is not every day that I am called upon to\\n- **PADME** to **JAR JAR** : You\\'re a good friend, Jar Jar. I don\\'t wish to hold you up. I\\'m sure you have a great deal to do.\\n- **JAR JAR** to **PADME** : Of course, milady.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : I do not like this idea of hiding.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Don\\'t worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won\\'t take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : I haven\\'t worked for a year to defeat the \"Military Creation Act\" not to be here when its fate is decided.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : I\\'m sorry, Anakin. It\\'s impossible to deny you\\'ve that you\\'ve grown up.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. Don\\'t get me wrong Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only although I\\'m a Padawan learner, in some ways a lot of ways I\\'m ahead of him. I\\'m ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I\\'m too unpredictable Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it I know I started my training late but he won\\'t let me move on.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : That must be frustrating.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : It\\'s worse he\\'s overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn\\'t understand! It\\'s not fair!\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It\\'s the only way we grow.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I know\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin. Don\\'t try to grow up too fast.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I am grown up. You said it yourself\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Please don\\'t look at me like that.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Why not?\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : It makes me feel uncomfortable.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Sorry, milady.\\n\\n_INT.

I worry about you. What if they realise I\\'m not you?\\n- **PADME** to **DORME** : Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Yes, Master.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **PADME** : I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady. You\\'ll be back here in no time.\\n- **PADME** to **OBI-WAN** : I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Time to go.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : I know.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : May the Force be with you.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : May the Force be with you, Master.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Suddenly, I\\'m afraid\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I\\'m kinda scared too.

So, my friend. What can I do for ya?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : You can tell me what this is.\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : Well, whattaya know. I ain\\'t seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : Do you know where it came from ?\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : Kamino Kyberdart I wonder why it didn\\'t show up in any analysis archive.\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : It\\'s these funny little cuts on the side give it away Those analysis droids you\\'ve got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn\\'t be here, would we? Kamino doesn\\'t sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : No, it\\'s beyond the Outer Rim. I\\'d say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They\\'re cloners. Damned good ones, too.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : Cloners? Are they friendly?\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : It depends.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **DEXTER JETTSTER** : On what, Dex?\\n- **DEXTER JETTSTER** to **OBI-WAN** : On how good your manners are and how big your pocketbook is.\\n\\n_INT.

It doesn\\'t seem to show upon any of the archive charts.\\n- **JOCASTA NU** to **OBI-WAN** : Kamino? It\\'s not a system I\\'M familiar with Let me see. Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **JOCASTA NU** : According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere just south of the Rishi Maze.\\n- **JOCASTA NU** to **OBI-WAN** : It ought to be. Unless it was very recent. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you\\'re searching for doesn\\'t exist. That\\'s impossible perhaps the archives are incomplete.\\n- **JOCASTA NU** to **JOCASTA NU** : If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!\\n\\n_INT.

I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi\\'s life, so you might say we\\'re encouraged to love.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : You have changed so much\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : You haven\\'t changed a bit.

I trust him. But the system doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show up on the archive maps.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. How embarrassing. How embarrassing! Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds and find Obi-Wan\\'s wayward planet we will.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : This is where it ought to be but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here but there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\n- **YODA** to **CHILDREN** : Most interesting. Gravity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?\\n- **CHILDREN** to **YODA** : Because someone erased it from the archive memory.\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. The data must have been erased.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\n- **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will.\\n\\n_EXT.

I\\'m not sure I was ready.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. The new Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn\\'t refuse her.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I agree! I think the Republic needs you I\\'m glad you chose to serve.\\n\\n_INT.

There hasn\\'t been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.\\n- **QUEEN JAMILLIA** to **PADME** : Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?\\n- **PADME** to **QUEEN JAMILLIA** : Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don\\'t have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I\\'m sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.\\n- **BIBBLE** to **QUEEN JAMILLIA** : It\\'s outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, NUTE is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?\\n- **QUEEN JAMILLIA** to **PADME** : We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.\\n- **PADME** to **QUEEN JAMILLIA** : Let\\'s pray that day never comes.\\n- **QUEEN JAMILLIA** to **PADME** : In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.\\n- **BIBBLE** to **PADME** : What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?\\n- **PADME** to **BIBBLE** : Anakin\\'s not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He\\'s still a Padawan learner. I was thinking\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Hey, hold on a minute!\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Excuse me? I am in charge of security here, milady.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Ani, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well that is why we\\'re here.

He\\'s still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\'m so sorry to hear that. But I\\'m sure he would have been proud of the army we\\'ve built for him.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : The army ?\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : Yes, a clone army, and I must say one of the finest we\\'ve ever created.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : Tell me, Prime Minister when my master first contacted you about the army did he say who it was for?\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : Of course he did. This army is for the Republic. But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : That\\'s why I\\'m here.\\n\\n_EXT.

This group was created about five years ago.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : You mentioned growth acceleration.\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : Oh, yes, it\\'s essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : I see.\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : Who was the original host?\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : Where is this bounty hunter now?\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he\\'s free to come and go as he pleases.\\n\\n_INT.

No tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LAMA SU** : I would like to meet this Jango Fett.\\n- **TAUN WE** to **OBI-WAN** : I would be most happy to arrange it, for you.\\n- **LAMA SU** to **OBI-WAN** : Magnificent, aren\\'t they?\\n\\n_EXT.

I don\\'t think the system works.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : How would you have it work?\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what\\'s in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don\\'t wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.\\n- **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Then they should be made to.\\n- **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : By whom?

Clear your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army at the request of the senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that.

The shadow of greed, that is.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **YODA** : What must I do, Master Yoda?\\n* **YODA** to **ANAKIN** : Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\\n\\n*79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY*\\n\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\'m sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What\\'s wrong then?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Be careful of what?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : He has requested your presence.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What for?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : He would not say.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : He didn\\'t inform the Jedi Council? That\\'s unusual, isn\\'t it?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : All of this is unusual, and it\\'s making me feel uneasy.\\n\\n*80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-DAY*\\n\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I hope you trust me, Anakin.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : Of course.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I need your help, son.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : What do you mean?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I\\'m depending on you.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : For what? I don\\'t understand.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin I\\'m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I think they will they need you more than you know.\\n\\n*83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY*\\n\\n* **YODA** to **ANAKIN** : Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **YODA** : I understand.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : What? ! How can you do this? This is outrageous, it\\'s unfair. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : Take a seat, young Skywalker.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : Forgive me, Master.\\n* **KI-ADI** to **MACE WINDU** : We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : It may take some time we do not have many ships to spare.\\n* **KI-ADI** to **YODA** : What about the droid attack on the WOOKIES?\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **KI-ADI** : It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **MACE WINDU** : He\\'s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It\\'s the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Go, I will. Good relations with the WOOKIES, I have.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **YODA** : It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the WOOKIES on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.\\n\\n*84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON*\\n\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!? That\\'s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It\\'s insulting!\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age, it\\'s never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you\\'re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn\\'t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : I swear to you, I didn\\'t ask to be put on the Council \\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : But it\\'s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : That has nothing to do with this.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : And?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn\\'t want to see you put in this situation.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : What situation?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor\\'s dealings. They want to know what he\\'s up to.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That\\'s treason!\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : We are at war, Anakin.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Why didn\\'t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He\\'s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : You\\'re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend. That\\'s what\\'s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : The Council is asking you.\\n\\n*86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY*\\n\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **OBI-WAN** : It\\'s very dangerous, putting them together. I don\\'t think the boy can handle it. I don\\'t trust him.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **MACE WINDU** : With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **OBI-WAN** : So the prophecy says.\\n* **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : A prophecy that misread could have been.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **YODA** : He will not let me down. He never has.\\n* **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.\\n\\n*87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET*\\n\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Sometimes, I wonder what\\'s happening to the Jedi Order I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? \\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : What do you mean?\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I don\\'t believe that. And you\\'re sounding like a Separatist!\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen Now, you\\'re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Don\\'t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I\\'m not your errand boy. I\\'m not anyone\\'s errand boy!\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : What is it?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Nothing.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Don\\'t do this don\\'t shut me out. Let me help you.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago when there was nothing but our love No politics, no plotting no war.\\n\\n*88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT*\\n\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : You wanted to see me, Chancellor.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : At last, we\\'ll be able to capture that monster and end this war.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn\\'t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far but, they can\\'t always be trusted to do the right thing.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Sit down, Leave us.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, you know I\\'m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven\\'t included you in their plot, they soon will.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I\\'m not sure I understand.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : You must sense what I have come to suspect the Jedi Council want control of the Republic they\\'re planning to betray me.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I don\\'t think \\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don\\'t you?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I know they don\\'t trust you \\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Or the Senate or the Republic or democracy for that matter.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn\\'t they?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : They asked you to spy on me, didn\\'t they?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I don\\'t know I don\\'t know what to say.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : The Jedi use their power for good.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be \\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : evil.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : from a Jedi\\'s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : And the Jedi don\\'t?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : The Jedi are selfless they only care about others.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : No.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I thought not. It\\'s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\\'s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : He could actually save people from death?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : What happened to him?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It\\'s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : Is it possible to learn this power?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Not from a Jedi.\\n\\n*90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY*\\n\\n* **KI-ADI** to **YODA** : Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **YODA** : A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.\\n* **YODA** to **ANAKIN** : Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **ANAKIN** : The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : A Master is needed, with more experience.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **YODA** : Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi Master Kenobi.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : Obi-Wan, my choice is.\\n* **KI-ADI** to **OBI-WAN** : I concur. Master Kenobi should go.\\n* **YODA** to **OBI-WAN** : I agree.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **YODA** : Very well. Council is adjourned.\\n\\n*91 INT.

However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Master! Master, I\\'ve disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training I have been arrogant and I apologize I\\'ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won\\'t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **OBI-WAN** : Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **ANAKIN** : Good-bye, old friend.

Just don\\'t take too long.\\n* **CLONE COMMANDER CODY** to **OBI-WAN** : Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?\\n* **OBI-WAN** to **CLONE COMMANDER CODY** : Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.\\n* **CLONE COMMANDER CODY** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\'m counting on you.\\n\\n*102 INT.

He says you\\'re under a lot of stress.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : And he\\'s not?\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : You have been moody lately.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I\\'m not moody \\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin! Don\\'t do this again.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I don\\'t know I feel lost.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Lost? What do you mean? You\\'re always so sure of yourself. I don\\'t understand.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Obi-Wan and the Council don\\'t trust me.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : Something\\'s happening I\\'m not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I\\'m not satisfied I want more, and I know I shouldn\\'t.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : You expect too much of yourself.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I have found a way to save you.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Save me?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : From my nightmares.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : Is that what\\'s bothering you?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PADME** : I won\\'t lose you, Padme.\\n* **PADME** to **ANAKIN** : I\\'m not going to die in childbirth, Annie.

Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his\\nintentions.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : Yes, Master.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **KI-ADI** : I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.\\n* **KI-ADI** to **MACE WINDU** : If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.\\n* **MACE WINDU** to **KI-ADI** : That could be a dangerous move the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition.\\n* **YODA** to **MACE WINDU** : To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.

Don\\'t you wonder why they won\\'t make you a Jedi Master?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : They don\\'t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : How do you know the ways of the Force?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : My mentor taught me everything about the Force even the nature of the dark side.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : You know the dark side?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : What did you say?\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : Use my knowledge, I beg you \\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : You\\'re a Sith Lord!\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : I know what has been troubling you Listen to me.

But you\\'re not sure of their intentions, are you?\\n* **ANAKIN** to **PALPATINE** : I will quickly discover the truth of all this.\\n* **PALPATINE** to **ANAKIN** : You have great wisdom, Anakin.

We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.\\n* **ANAKIN** to **MACE WINDU** : He won\\'t give up his power. I\\'ve just learned a terrible truth.

And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : You mean the next semester before harvest?\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Sure, there\\'re more than enough droids.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we\\'ll make enough on the harvest so I\\'ll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : You must understand I need you here, Luke.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : But it\\'s a whole another year.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Look, it\\'s only one more season.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Yeah, that\\'s what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\\n- **BERU** to **LUKE** : Where are you going?\\n- **LUKE** to **BERU** : It looks like I\\'m going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.\\n- **BERU** to **OWEN** : Owen, he can\\'t stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : I\\'ll make it up to him next year. I promise.\\n- **BERU** to **OWEN** : Luke\\'s just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : That\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.\\n\\n## INT.

I told him not to go, but he\\'s faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Oh, no!\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\\n\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can\\'t understand their logic at times.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : How could I be so stupid? He\\'s nowhere in sight. Blast it!\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Pardon me, sir, but couldn\\'t we go after him?\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : It\\'s too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We\\'ll have to wait until morning.\\n- **OWEN** to **LUKE** : Luke, I\\'m shutting the power down for the night.\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : All right, I\\'ll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Oh, he excels at that, sir.\\n\\n## INT.

Did he take those two new droids with him?\\n- **BERU** to **OWEN** : I think so.\\n- **OWEN** to **BERU** : Well, he\\'d better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there\\'ll be hell to pay!\\n\\n## INT./EXT.

We\\'ll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish. and don\\'t talk to me about your mission, either. You\\'re fortunate he doesn\\'t blast you into a million pieces right here.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Well, come on. It\\'s getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : What\\'s wrong with him now?\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Oh my. sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Sandpeople!

You\\'re fortunate you\\'re still in one piece.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Oh, this little droid! I think he\\'s searching for his former master. I\\'ve never seen such devotion in a droid before. there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he\\'s talking about?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven\\'t heard in a long time. a long time.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Oh, he\\'s not dead, not. not yet.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You know him!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Well of course, of course I know him. He\\'s me! I haven\\'t gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\\n- **ARTOO** to **OBI-WAN** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Then the droid does belong to you.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Don\\'t seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\\n- **ARTOO** to **LUKE** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **ARTOO** : Threepio!\\n\\n## EXT.

We\\'ve got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : I don\\'t think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There\\'s no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I\\'m done for.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : No, you\\'re not. What kind of talk is that?\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Quickly, son. they\\'re on the move.\\n\\n## INT. KENOBI\\'S DWELLING\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : No, my father didn\\'t fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : That\\'s what your uncle told you. He didn\\'t hold with your father\\'s ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You fought in the Clone Wars?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I wish I\\'d known him.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you\\'ve become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn\\'t allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **LUKE** : Sir, if you\\'ll not be needing me, I\\'ll close down for awhile.\\n- **LUKE** to **THREEPIO** : Sure, go ahead.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : What is it?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : How did my father die?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : The Force?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It\\'s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.\\n- **ARTOO** to **OBI-WAN** : beeps\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **ARTOO** : Now, let\\'s see if we can\\'t figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I saw part of the message he was.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I seem to have found it.\\n- **LEIA** to **OBI-WAN** : General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father\\'s request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I\\'m afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you\\'re my only hope.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You must learn the ways of the Force if you\\'re to come with me to Alderaan.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Alderaan? I\\'m not going to Alderaan. I\\'ve got to go home. It\\'s late, I\\'m in for it as it is.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I\\'m getting too old for this sort of thing.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I can\\'t get involved! I\\'ve got work to do! It\\'s not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there\\'s nothing I can do about it right now. It\\'s such a long way from here.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : That\\'s your uncle talking.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Learn about the Force, Luke.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you\\'re going.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You must do what you feel is right, of course.\\n\\n## INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\\n\\n- **TAGGE** to **MOTTI** : Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They\\'re more dangerous than you realize.\\n- **MOTTI** to **TAGGE** : Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!\\n- **TAGGE** to **MOTTI** : The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.\\n- **TARKIN** to **TAGGE** : The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I\\'ve just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.\\n- **TAGGE** to **TARKIN** : That\\'s impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\\n- **TARKIN** to **TAGGE** : The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.\\n- **TAGGE** to **TARKIN** : And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **TAGGE** : The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.\\n- **MOTTI** to **DARTH VADER** : Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they\\'ve obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **MOTTI** : Don\\'t be too proud of this technological terror you\\'ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\\n- **MOTTI** to **DARTH VADER** : Don\\'t try to frighten us with your sorcerer\\'s ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel\\'s hidden fort.\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **MOTTI** : I find your lack of faith disturbing.\\n- **TARKIN** to **DARTH VADER** : Enough of this! Vader, release him!\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **TARKIN** : As you wish.\\n- **TARKIN** to **DARTH VADER** : This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It\\'s just. I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : They didn\\'t. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : These are the same Jawas that sold us ARTOO and Threepio.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Wait, Luke! It\\'s too dangerous.\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OWEN** : Uncle Owen! BERU!

You\\'d have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I want to come with you to Alderaan. There\\'s nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.\\n\\n## EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND\\n\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Mos Eisley Spaceport.

You will find it a powerful ally.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Do you really think we\\'re going to find a pilot here that\\'ll take us to Alderaan?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\'m ready for anything.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : Come along, ARTOO.\\n- **ARTOO** to **THREEPIO** : beeps\\n\\n## INT.

You\\'ve never heard of the Millennium Falcon?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **HAN SOLO** : Should I have?\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : It\\'s the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : I\\'ve outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I\\'m talking about the big Corellian ships now. She\\'s fast enough for you, old man. What\\'s the cargo?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **HAN SOLO** : Only passengers.

Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.\\n\\n## INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **CHEWBACCA** : Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they\\'re going to try to cut us off.\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : Why don\\'t you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : Watch your mouth, kid, or you\\'re going to find yourself floating home. We\\'ll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We\\'ll lose them!\\n\\n## INT.

At the rate they\\'re gaining.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : Traveling through hyperspace isn\\'t like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that\\'d end your trip real quick, wouldn\\'t it?\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : What\\'s that flashing?\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : We\\'re losing our deflector shield.

DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\\n\\n- **MOTTI** to **TARKIN** : We\\'ve entered the Alderaan system.\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader\\'s leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\\n- **TARKIN** to **LEIA** : Charming to the last. You don\\'t know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!\\n- **TARKIN** to **LEIA** : Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\\n- **TARKIN** to **LEIA** : Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that\\'ll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station\\'s destructive power, on your home planet of Alderaan.\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can\\'t possibly.\\n- **TARKIN** to **LEIA** : You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!\\n- **TARKIN** to **LEIA** : I grow tired of asking this. So it\\'ll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : Dantooine.\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : They\\'re on Dantooine.\\n- **TARKIN** to **DARTH VADER** : There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : What?\\n- **TARKIN** to **LEIA** : You\\'re far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don\\'t worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.\\n- **LEIA** to **TARKIN** : No!\\n\\n## INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA\\n\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Are you all right?

I fear something terrible has happened.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You\\'d better get on with your exercises.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.

Screaming about it won\\'t help you.\\n- **CHEWBACCA** to **THREEPIO** : barks\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **THREEPIO** : Let him have it. It\\'s not wise to upset a Wookiee.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **HAN SOLO** : But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **THREEPIO** : That\\'s \\'cause droids don\\'t pull people\\'s arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.\\n- **THREEPIO** to **ARTOO** : I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, ARTOO. Let the Wookiee win.\\n- **CHEWBACCA** to **THREEPIO** : barks\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You mean it controls your actions?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Partially. But it also obeys your commands.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : You don\\'t believe in the Force, do you?\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : Kid, I\\'ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I\\'ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I\\'ve never seen anything to make me believe there\\'s one all-powerful force controlling everything. There\\'s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : It\\'s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I suggest you try it again, Luke.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : With the blast shield down, I can\\'t even see. How am I supposed to fight?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Your eyes can deceive you. Don\\'t trust them.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Stretch out with your feelings.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You see, you can do it.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : I call it luck.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **HAN SOLO** : In my experience, there\\'s no such thing as luck.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That\\'s something else.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : Looks like we\\'re coming up on Alderaan.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : That\\'s good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.\\n\\n## INT.

They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\\n- **TARKIN** to **DARTH VADER** : She lied! She lied to us!\\n- **DARTH VADER** to **TARKIN** : I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.\\n- **TARKIN** to **DARTH VADER** : Terminate her. immediately!\\n\\n## INT.

Where is it?\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : Thats what I\\'m trying to tell you, kid. It ain\\'t there. It\\'s been totally blown away.\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : What? How?\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Destroyed. by the Empire!\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : The entire starfleet couldn\\'t destroy the whole planet. It\\'d take a thousand ships with more fire power than I\\'ve.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : There\\'s another ship coming in.\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : Maybe they know what happened.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : It\\'s an Imperial fighter.\\n- **CHEWBACCA** to **HAN SOLO** : barks\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : It followed us!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **HAN SOLO** : No. It\\'s a short range fighter.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : There aren\\'t any bases around here.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\\n\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : A fighter that size couldn\\'t get this deep into space on its own.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : Well, he ain\\'t going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us\\n\\n## INT.

It\\'s a space station.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **OBI-WAN** : It\\'s too big to be a space station.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I have a very bad feeling about this.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **CHEWBACCA** : Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.\\n- **CHEWBACCA** to **THREEPIO** : barks\\n- **LUKE** to **HAN SOLO** : Why are we still moving towards it?\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LUKE** : We\\'re caught in a tractor beam!

It\\'s defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.\\n- **GOLD LEADER** to **DODONNA** : Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\\n- **DODONNA** to **PILOTS** : Well, the Empire doesn\\'t consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they\\'d have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.\\n- **DODONNA** to **PILOTS** : The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It\\'s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\\n- **DODONNA** to **PILOTS** : Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you\\'ll have to use proton torpedoes.\\n- **WEDGE** to **LUKE** : That\\'s impossible, even for a computer.\\n- **LUKE** to **WEDGE** : It\\'s not impossible.

Why didn\\'t you tell me?\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true. from a certain point of view.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : A certain point of view!\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Luke, you\\'re going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I don\\'t blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn\\'t have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Anakin was a good friend.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : There\\'s still good in him.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn\\'t be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I can\\'t do it, Ben.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : You cannot escape your destiny.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I tried to stop him once. I couldn\\'t do it.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke. but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : But I had to help my friends.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I found out Darth Vader was my father.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : to be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn\\'t get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You\\'re no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : I can\\'t kill my own father.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Yoda spoke of another.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : The other he spoke of is your twin sister.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : But I have no sister.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Hmm. to protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : Leia! Leia\\'s my sister.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : When your father left, he didn\\'t know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine. and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage. no one knew she\\'d been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father\\'s path, became a senator as well. That\\'s not all she became, of course. she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That\\'s what she was doing when her path crossed yours. for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.\\n- **LUKE** to **OBI-WAN** : But you can\\'t let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\\n- **OBI-WAN** to **LUKE** : She hasn\\'t been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke. but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!\\n\\n## 53 INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM\\n\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : Well, look at you, a general, huh?\\n- **LANDO** to **HAN SOLO** : Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : Well, don\\'t look at me, pal.

We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we\\'ve learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.\\n- **CHEWBACCA** to **HAN SOLO** : BARKS\\n- **MON MOTHMA** to **REBEL PILOTS** : Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\\n- **ACKBAR** to **REBEL PILOTS** : You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\\n- **ACKBAR** to **REBEL PILOTS** : General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : Good luck.\\n- **HAN SOLO** to **LANDO** : You\\'re gonna need it.\\n- **ACKBAR** to **GENERAL MADINE** : General Madine.\\n- **GENERAL MADINE** to **REBEL PILOTS** : We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.
