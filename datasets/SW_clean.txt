 Star Wars : Episode 1 : The Phantom Menace

> TITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away

> EPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE
>
> Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict

 INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT 

 QUI-GON to REPUBLIC PILOT : Captain.
 REPUBLIC PILOT to QUI-GON : Yes, sir?
 QUI-GON to REPUBLIC PILOT : Tell them we wish to board at once.
 REPUBLIC PILOT to QUI-GON : Yes, sir.
 REPUBLIC PILOT to NUTE : With all due respect the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately.
 NUTE to REPUBLIC PILOT : Yes, yes, of course as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador. Happy to.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE 

 TC-14 to QUI-GON : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM 

 TC-14 to QUI-GON : We are greatly honored by your visit, Ambassadors. Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.
 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : I have a bad feeling about this.
 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : I don't sense anything.
 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : It's not about the mission, Master, it's something, elsewhere, elusive.
 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs.
 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future
 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.
 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : Yes, Master how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?
 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE 

 NUTE to TC-14 : What?!? What did you say?
 TC-14 to NUTE : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
 DOFINE to NUTE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh.
 NUTE to DOFINE : Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.
 DOFINE to NUTE : Are you brain-dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi .Send a droid.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM 

 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?
 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE 

 DARTH SIDIOUS to NUTE : What is it?
 DOFINE to DARTH SIDIOUS : This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished. We dare not go against these Jedi.
 DARTH SIDIOUS to NUTE : Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again. This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops.
 NUTE to DARTH SIDIOUS : My lord, is that legal?
 DARTH SIDIOUS to NUTE : I will make it legal.
 NUTE to DARTH SIDIOUS : And the Jedi?
 DARTH SIDIOUS to NUTE : The chancellor should never have brought them into this. Kill them immediately.
 NUTE to DARTH SIDIOUS : Yes, my lord. As you wish.

 INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT

 CAPORAL DROID to CAPTAIN DROID : Roger, roger.
 CAPTAIN DROID to CAPORAL DROID : Blast them.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE 

 NUTE to TEY HOW : What in blazes is going on down there?
 TEY HOW to NUTE : We lost the transmission, sir.
 RUNE to NUTE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
 NUTE to RUNE : Well, not exactly, but I don't seal off the bridge.
 RUNE to NUTE : That won't be enough, sir.
 NUTE to RUNE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!
 RUNE to NUTE : We will not survive this.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE 

 NUTE to TEY HOW : Close the blast doors!
 NUTE to TEY HOW : That will hold them.
 RUNE to NUTE : They're still coming through!
 NUTE to RUNE : Impossible! This is impossible!
 RUNE to NUTE : Where are those destroyer droids?!

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE 

 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : Master! Destroyers!
 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : They have shield generators!
 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : It's a standoff. Let's go.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE 

 RUNE to NUTE : They're no match for destroyer droids.
 TEY HOW to NUTE : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY 

 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : Battle droids.
 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : It's an invasion army.
 QUI-GON to OBI-WAN : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.
 OBI-WAN to QUI-GON : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short.

 INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE 

 TEY HOW to NUTE : Sir, a transmission from the planet.
 RUNE to NUTE : It's Queen Amidala herself.
 NUTE to RUNE : At last we're getting results.
 NUTE to NUTE : Again you come before me, Your highness.
 AMIDALA to NUTE : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.
 NUTE to AMIDALA : I was not aware of such a failure.
 AMIDALA to NUTE : I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now and that you have been commanded to reach settlement.
 NUTE to AMIDALA : I know nothing of any ambassadors. You must be mistaken.
 AMIDALA to NUTE : Beware, Viceroy the Federation is going too far this time.
 NUTE to AMIDALA : We would never do anything without the approval of the senate. You assume too much.
 AMIDALA to NUTE : We will see.
 RUNE to NUTE : She's right, the Senate will never
 NUTE to RUNE : It's too late now.
 RUNE to NUTE : Do you think she suspects an attack?
 NUTE to NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.

 INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM 

 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : Negotiations haven't started because the ambassadors aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive. It must handiwork negotiate ambassadors
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : Senator Palpatine?!? What's happening?
 BIBBLE to AMIDALA : A communications disruption can mean only one thing : invasion.
 PANAKA to AMIDALA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
 BIBBLE to AMIDALA : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
 AMIDALA to BIBBLE : The Federation would not dare go that far.
 PANAKA to AMIDALA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.
 AMIDALA to BIBBLE : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
 BIBBLE to AMIDALA : Negotiation? We've lost all communications! and where are the Chancellors Ambassadors?
 PANAKA to AMIDALA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
 AMIDALA to PANAKA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

 SHMI to ANAKIN : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you
 ANAKIN to SHMI : Watto doesn't know I've built it.
 ANAKIN to QUI-GON : You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
 SHMI to ANAKIN : I don't want you to race, Annie It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
 ANAKIN to SHMI : But Mom, I love it and they need help they're in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.

 WATTO to QUI-GON : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think.
 QUI-GON to WATTO : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need If we lose, you keep my ship.

 QUI-GON to SHMI : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
 SHMI to QUI-GON : He deserves better than a slave's life.
 QUI-GON to SHMI : Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father?
 SHMI to QUI-GON : There was no father, that I know of I carried him, I gave him birth I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?

 QUI-GON to WATTO : For the fastest Pod ever built?!

 WATTO to QUI-GON : No Pod's worth two slaves not by a long shot one slave or nothing.
 QUI-GON to WATTO : The boy, then

 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : What options do we have?
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : He has been our strongest supporter.
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator more and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : There is something I cannot do.

 MACE WINDU to QUI-GON : Located around a person?
 QUI-GON to YODA : A boy his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.
 MACE WINDU to QUI-GON : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force you believe it's this boy?
 QUI-GON to MACE WINDU : I don't pressume
 YODA to QUI-GON : But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.

 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion to a vote?
 VALORUM to SENAT : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.
 PALPATINE to SENAT : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the Trade Federation.
 LOTT DOD to SENAT : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
 VALORUM to LOTT DOD : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your station.
 PALPATINE to VALORUM : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.
 AMIDALA to SENAT : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force. Invaded against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the Trade
 LOTT DOD to SENAT : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
 AKS MOE to SENAT : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed that is the law.
 VALORUM to SENAT : The point
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.
 VALORUM to AMIDALA : The point is conceded Section 523A take precedence here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?
 AMIDALA to VALORUM : I will not defer I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a "vote of no confidence" in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
 MAS AMEDDA to SENAT : Order! We shall have order
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue

 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do here Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have decided to go back to Naboo.
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : Go back! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from that of our people. Captain!
 PANAKA to AMIDALA : Yes, Your Highness?
 AMIDALA to PANAKA : Ready my ship!
 PALPATINE to AMIDALA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here where it's safe.
 AMIDALA to PALPATINE : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy.

 ANAKIN to QUI-GON : They live inside of me?
 QUI-GON to ANAKIN : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
 ANAKIN to QUI-GON : Symbionts?
 QUI-GON to ANAKIN : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you.

 PADME to PANAKA : What is the situation?
 PANAKA to PADME : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
 PADME to PANAKA : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, PANAKA will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused. What do you think, Master Jedi?
 QUI-GON to PADME : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
 PANAKA to PADME : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
 QUI-GON to BOSS NASS : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be killed.
 BOSS NASS to QUI-GON : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.
 PADME to QUI-GON : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless.
 QUI-GON to PADME : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
 OBI-WAN to PADME : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.
 PADME to OBI-WAN : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it.

This separatist movement has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Kights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. Senator PADME, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to Coruscant to vote on the critical issue of creating an army to assist the overwhelmed Jedi.

- MACE WINDU to PADME : Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
- PADME to MACE WINDU : I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
- MACE WINDU to PADME : You know, milady, COUNT DOOKU was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.
- KI-ADI to PADME : He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
- YODA to PADME : In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
- PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
- BAIL ORGANA to PALPATINE : Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
- PADME to PALPATINE : Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the
- PALPATINE to PADME : "situation is that serious." No, but I do, Senator. I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with an old friend like Master Kenobi
- MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.
- PALPATINE to PADME : Do it for me, milady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.
- MACE WINDU to PADME : I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : You seem a little on edge.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Not at all.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : I haven't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of gundarks.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : You fell into that nightmare, Master and I rescued you, remember?
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Oh, yes.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.
- JAR JAR to OBI-WAN : Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!
- OBI-WAN to JAR JAR : It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING_

- JAR JAR to PADME : Lookie lookie Oops! Oh, dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten myself again.
- OBI-WAN to PADME : It's a great pleasure to see you again, milady.
- PADME to OBI-WAN : It has been far too long Master Kenobi.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Ani? My goodness you've grown.
- ANAKIN to PADME : So have you grown more beautiful, I mean and much shorter for a Senator, I mean.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Oh Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
- OBI-WAN to PADME : Our presence will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.
- CAPTAIN TYPHO to OBI-WAN : I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service. Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment. I am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.
- PADME to CAPTAIN TYPHO : I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.
- OBI-WAN to PADME : We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.
- ANAKIN to PADME : We will find out who is trying to kill you PADME, I promise you.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Why?
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : What?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.
- PADME to OBI-WAN : Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now if you will excuse me I will retire.
- CAPTAIN TYPHO to OBI-WAN : Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. I'll have an officer on every floor and I'll be at the command centre downstairs.
- JAR JAR to ANAKIN : Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Ani. Deesa bad times, bombad times.
- ANAKIN to JAR JAR : She didn't even recognize me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted and she's forgotten me completely.
- JAR JAR to ANAKIN : Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in longo time.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets check the security here.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, PADME'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : What's going on?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : What is she thinking?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : She programmed ARTOO to warn us if there's an intruder.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : You're using her as bait?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : It was her idea. Don't worry. No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : It's too risky and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : And yours are?
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Possibly.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, PADME'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : You look tired.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I don't sleep well, anymore.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Because of your mother?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I don't know why I keep dreaming about her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Dreams pass in time.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I'd rather dream of PADME. Just Being around her again is intoxicating.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order a commitment not easily broken and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics It's too early in the morning and besides, you're generalizing. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Palpatine is a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I think he is a good man.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : I sense it, too.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, PADME'S APARTMENT - NIGHT_

- ANAKIN to PADME : Stay here!

_EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : What took you so long?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit and with the right speed capabilities.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I thought I already did.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Only in your mind, my very young apprentice! Pull up, Anakin. Pull up! You know I don't like it when you do that.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : I don't mind flying but what you're doing is suicide! It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Where are you going? He went down there, the other way.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he s working for. This is a shortcut I think.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Oh, so that s why we re going in the wrong direction. Well, you lost him.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I m deeply sorry, Master.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again you've proved.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Excuse me for a moment.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : I hate it when he does that.

_EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin!
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : She went into that club, Master.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Patience. Use the Force. Think.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : He went in there to hide, not to run.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : He must keep it with him at all times.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I know, Master.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : This weapon is your life!
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I try, Master.

_INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Don't say that Master You're the closest thing I have to a father I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Then why don't you listen to me?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I try.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Can you see him ?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I think he's a she and I think she is a changeling.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Then be extra careful. Go and find her.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Where are you going, Master?
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : To get a drink.
- ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO to OBI-WAN : Wanna buy some death sticks?
- OBI-WAN to ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO : You don't want to sell me death sticks.
- ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO to OBI-WAN : I don't want to sell you death- sticks.
- OBI-WAN to ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO : You want to go home and rethink your life.
- ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO to OBI-WAN : I want to go home and rethink my life.

_EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT_

- OBI-WAN to ZAM WESSEL : Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
- ZAM WESSEL to OBI-WAN : The Senator from Naboo.
- OBI-WAN to ZAM WESSEL : Who hired you?
- ZAM WESSEL to OBI-WAN : It was just a job.
- OBI-WAN to ZAM WESSEL : Who hired you? Tell us.
- ANAKIN to ZAM WESSEL : Tell us tell us now!
- ZAM WESSEL to OBI-WAN : It was a Bounty Hunter called
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Toxic Dart

_INT. JEDI BUILDING - DAY_

- YODA to OBI-WAN : Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan.
- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : Most importantly, find out who he's working for.
- OBI-WAN to YODA : What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Handle that your Padawan will.
- MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She'll be safer there. And don't use registered transport. Travel as refugees.
- ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.
- YODA to ANAKIN : Until caught this killer is our judgment she must respect.
- MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Anakin, go to the senate and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - DAY_

- PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that.
- ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Thank you, Your Excellency.
- PALPATINE to ANAKIN : And so, they've finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off.
- ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Your guidance more than my patience.
- PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times: You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.
- ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Thank you, Your Excellency.
- PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin even more powerful than Master Yoda.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, CORRIDOR - DAY_

- OBI-WAN to YODA : I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : The council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.
- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : The boy has exceptional skills.
- OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.
- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.

_INT. SENATE BUILDING, PADME'S APARTMENT - DAY_

- PADME to JAR JAR : I'm taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate. Representative Binks. I know I can count on you.
- JAR JAR to PADME : Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. It is not every day that I am called upon to
- PADME to JAR JAR : You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
- JAR JAR to PADME : Of course, milady.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I do not like this idea of hiding.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've that you've grown up.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. Don't get me wrong Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways a lot of ways I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it I know I started my training late but he won't let me move on.
- PADME to ANAKIN : That must be frustrating.
- ANAKIN to PADME : It's worse he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
- PADME to ANAKIN : All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I know
- PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin. Don't try to grow up too fast.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I am grown up. You said it yourself
- PADME to ANAKIN : Please don't look at me like that.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Why not?
- PADME to ANAKIN : It makes me feel uncomfortable.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Sorry, milady.

_INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY_

- CAPTAIN TYPHO to PADME : Be safe, milady.
- PADME to CAPTAIN TYPHO : Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme the threat's on you two now.
- DORME to PADME : He'll be safe with me.
- PADME to DORME : You'll be fine.
- DORME to PADME : It's not me, milady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you?
- PADME to DORME : Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
- OBI-WAN to PADME : I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady. You'll be back here in no time.
- PADME to OBI-WAN : I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Time to go.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I know.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : May the Force be with you.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : May the Force be with you, Master.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Suddenly, I'm afraid
- ANAKIN to PADME : I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own. Don't worry. We have ARTOO with us.
- ARTOO to ANAKIN : beeps
- OBI-WAN to CAPTAIN TYPHO : I hope he doesn't try anything foolish.
- CAPTAIN TYPHO to OBI-WAN : I'd be more concerned about her doing something, than him.

_INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING_

- HERMIONE BAGWA to DEXTER JETTSTER : Someone to see ya, honey. A Jedi by the looks of him.
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : Obi-Wan!
- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Hey, Dex.
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : Take a seat! Be right with ya!
- HERMIONE BAGWA to OBI-WAN : You want a cup of ardees?
- OBI-WAN to HERMIONE BAGWA : Thank you.
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : Hey, old buddy! So, my friend. What can I do for ya?
- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : You can tell me what this is.
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : Well, whattaya know. I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!
- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Do you know where it came from ?
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.
- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Kamino Kyberdart I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.
- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? Kamino doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.
- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : Cloners? Are they friendly?
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : It depends.
- OBI-WAN to DEXTER JETTSTER : On what, Dex?
- DEXTER JETTSTER to OBI-WAN : On how good your manners are and how big your pocketbook is.

_INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY_

- JOCASTA NU to OBI-WAN : Did you call for assistance?
- OBI-WAN to JOCASTA NU : Yes yes, I did
- JOCASTA NU to OBI-WAN : Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
- OBI-WAN to JOCASTA NU : Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.
- JOCASTA NU to OBI-WAN : Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with Let me see. Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?
- OBI-WAN to JOCASTA NU : According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere just south of the Rishi Maze.
- JOCASTA NU to OBI-WAN : It ought to be. Unless it was very recent. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist. That's impossible perhaps the archives are incomplete.
- JOCASTA NU to JOCASTA NU : If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!

_INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY_

- PADME to ANAKIN : It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like
- ANAKIN to PADME : Or be with the people I love.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
- PADME to ANAKIN : You have changed so much
- ANAKIN to PADME : You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.

_INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY_

- YODA to CHILDREN : Don't think feel be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
- CHILDREN to OBI-WAN : Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
- OBI-WAN to YODA : I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : What help to you, can I be?
- OBI-WAN to YODA : I m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn t show up on the archive maps.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. How embarrassing. How embarrassing! Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.
- OBI-WAN to YODA : This is where it ought to be but it isn t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here but there isn t.
- YODA to CHILDREN : Most interesting. Gravity s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
- CHILDREN to YODA : Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. The data must have been erased.
- OBI-WAN to YODA : But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That s impossible, isn t it?
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will.

_EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON_

- PADME to ANAKIN : I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.
- ANAKIN to PADME : The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. The new Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I agree! I think the Republic needs you I'm glad you chose to serve.

_INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON_

- PADME to QUEEN JAMILLIA : If the senate votes to create an army, it's sure to push us into a civil war.
- BIBBLE to PADME : It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.
- QUEEN JAMILLIA to PADME : Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
- PADME to QUEEN JAMILLIA : Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.
- BIBBLE to QUEEN JAMILLIA : It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, NUTE is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?
- QUEEN JAMILLIA to PADME : We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
- PADME to QUEEN JAMILLIA : Let's pray that day never comes.
- QUEEN JAMILLIA to PADME : In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.
- BIBBLE to PADME : What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
- PADME to BIBBLE : Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking
- ANAKIN to PADME : Hey, hold on a minute!
- PADME to ANAKIN : Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Excuse me? I am in charge of security here, milady.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Ani, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Sorry, milady.
- QUEEN JAMILLIA to PADME : Perfect. It's settled then.

_INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE_

- TAUN WE to OBI-WAN : Master Jedi, The Prime Minister expects you.
- OBI-WAN to TAUN WE : I'm expected?
- TAUN WE to OBI-WAN : Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way!

_INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY_

- TAUN WE to OBI-WAN : May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino and this is Master Jedi
- OBI-WAN to TAUN WE : Obi-Wan Kenobi.
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Please, I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season. And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : That is good news.
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope?
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : I'm sorry Master - ?
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : The army ?
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Yes, a clone army, and I must say one of the finest we've ever created.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Tell me, Prime Minister when my master first contacted you about the army did he say who it was for?
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Of course he did. This army is for the Republic. But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : That's why I'm here.

_EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON_

- PADME to ANAKIN : When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I don t like sand. It s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything s soft and smooth.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I shouldn't have done that.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I'm sorry.

_EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY_

- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Very impressive.
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : I'd hoped you would be pleased.

_INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY_

- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Clones can think creatively. You will find that they are immensely superior to droids. We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : You mentioned growth acceleration.
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Oh, yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : I see.
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Who was the original host?
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Where is this bounty hunter now?
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.

_INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY_

- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious is not it?
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : Unaltered?
- LAMA SU to LAMA SU : Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : I would like to meet this Jango Fett.
- TAUN WE to OBI-WAN : I would be most happy to arrange it, for you.
- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Magnificent, aren't they?

_EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON_

- PADME to ANAKIN : I don't know
- ANAKIN to PADME : Sure you do you just don't want to tell me.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
- ANAKIN to PADME : They only work on the weak-minded.
- PADME to ANAKIN : All right his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I very cute dark curly hair dreamy eyes.
- ANAKIN to PADME : All right, I get the picture whatever happened to him?
- PADME to ANAKIN : I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Maybe he was the smart one.
- PADME to ANAKIN : You really don't like politicians, do you?
- ANAKIN to PADME : I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.
- PADME to ANAKIN : How would you have it work?
- ANAKIN to PADME : We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
- PADME to ANAKIN : That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Then they should be made to.
- PADME to ANAKIN : By whom? Who's going to make them?
- ANAKIN to PADME : I don't know. Someone.
- PADME to ANAKIN : You?
- ANAKIN to PADME : Of course not me.
- PADME to ANAKIN : But someone.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Someone wise.
- PADME to ANAKIN : That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Well, if it works
- PADME to ANAKIN : You're making fun of me.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Oh no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.

_INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY_

- TAUN WE to JANGO FETT : Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive?
- JANGO FETT to TAUN WE : Fairly.
- TAUN WE to JANGO FETT : This is Jedi Master, OBI-WAN Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress.
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi.
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : Once or twice.
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : Recently?
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : Possibly
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas?
- JANGO FETT to BOBA FETT : Boba, close the door.
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : Master who?
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : Sifo-Dyas. Isn t he the Jedi who hired you for this job?
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : No? I thought
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : Do you like your army?
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : It seems to me it's your army - being that they are all clones of you.
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : They'll do their job well, I'll guarantee that.
- OBI-WAN to JANGO FETT : I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time, Jango.
- JANGO FETT to OBI-WAN : Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
- BOBA FETT to JANGO FETT : What is it, Dad?
- JANGO FETT to BOBA FETT : Pack your things. We're leaving.

_INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, EAT - TWILIGHT_

- ANAKIN to PADME : And when I got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations.
- PADME to ANAKIN : "Aggressive negotiations"? What's that?
- ANAKIN to PADME : Well, negotiations with a lightsaber. If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

_INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT_

- ANAKIN to PADME : From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask. If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Anything's possible. Padme, please listen
- PADME to ANAKIN : You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go regardless of the way we feel about each other.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Then you do feel something! That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings but I can't.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I am not going to give into this.
- ANAKIN to PADME : It wouldn't have to be that way we could keep it a secret.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
- ANAKIN to PADME : No, you're right. It would destroy us

_INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY_

- LAMA SU to OBI-WAN : Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them.
- OBI-WAN to LAMA SU : I won't forget. Thank you.

_EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING_

- OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we are looking for.
- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?
- OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : No, Master. There appears to be no motive.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.
- OBI-WAN to YODA : Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army at the request of the senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?
- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Bring him here. Question him we will.
- OBI-WAN to YODA : Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him.
- YODA to MACE WINDU : Blind we are if creation of this clone army we could not see.
- MACE WINDU to YODA : I think it is time we informed the senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.
- YODA to MACE WINDU : Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the senate is multiply our adversaries will.

_EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING_

- PADME to ANAKIN : You had a nightmare again last night.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Jedi don't have nightmares.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I heard you.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.
- PADME to ANAKIN : I'll go with you.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

- WATTO to ANAKIN : Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?
- ANAKIN to WATTO : Do you know where they are?
- WATTO to ANAKIN : Long way from here someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think

- THREEPIO to ANAKIN : Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Ani.

_INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY_

- CLIEGG to ANAKIN : It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusekn Raiders. Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I'd be with them, only I just couldn't ride any more until I heal. This isn't the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn't how your mother and I planned it. I don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.
- OWEN to ANAKIN : Where are you going?
- ANAKIN to OWEN : To find my mother.
- CLIEGG to ANAKIN : She's dead, son. Accept it.

- NUTE to COUNT DOOKU : What about the senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.
- COUNT DOOKU to NUTE : I am a man of my word, Viceroy. As I explained to you earlier I am quite convinced that 10,000 more systems will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen. Good. Very good. Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support and when their battle droids are combined with yours we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy. The Jedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make.

_INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT_

- PADME to ANAKIN : I brought you something. Are you hungry?
- ANAKIN to PADME : The shifter broke. Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things. I'm good at fixing things. Always was. But I couldn't. Why'd she have to die? Why couldn't I save her? I know I could have!
- PADME to ANAKIN : Sometimes there are things no one can fix. You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Well, I should be! Someday I will be. I will be the most powerful Jedi ever. I promise you. I will even learn to stop people from dying. It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous! He's holding me back!
- PADME to ANAKIN : What's wrong, Ani?
- ANAKIN to PADME : I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. And not just the men but the women and the children too. They're like animals and I slaughtered them like animals! I hate them!
- PADME to ANAKIN : To be angry is to be human.
- ANAKIN to PADME : I'm a Jedi. I know I'm better than this.
- CLIEGG to SHMI : I know wherever you are it's become a better place. You were the most loving partner a man could ever have. Good-bye, my darling wife. And thank you.
- ANAKIN to SHMI : I wasn't strong enough. But I promise I won't fail again. I miss you so much.
- PADME to ARTOO : ARTOO? What are you doing here?

- THREEPIO to ANAKIN : It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you?

_INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant. I have tracked the bounty hunter, Jango Fett to the droid foundries on Geonosis. The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala. The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming. Wait.
- YODA to MACE WINDU : More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.
- MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : I agree. We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you is to stay where you are. Protect the senator at all costs. That is your first priority.
- ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Understood, Master.
- PADME to ANAKIN : They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look. Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
- ANAKIN to PADME : If he's still alive.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Are you just gonna sit here and let him die? He's your friend, your mentor.
- ANAKIN to PADME : He's like my father! But you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
- PADME to ANAKIN : He gave you strict orders to protect me and I'm going to help Obi-Wan. If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : I'm not worried, R2. It's just I've never flown before.

_INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE_

- BAIL ORGANA to PALPATINE : The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war there can be no doubt of that.
- PALPATINE to BAIL ORGANA : Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
- MACE WINDU to BAIL ORGANA : We must stop them soon before they're fully ready.
- ASK MOE to PALPATINE : The debate is over, we need that clone army now!
- BAIL ORGANA to ASK MOE : Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.
- MAS AMEDDA to BAIL ORGANA : This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute.
- PALPATINE to MAS AMEDDA : But what senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment?
- MAS AMEDDA to PALPATINE : If only Senator Amidala were here.

_INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY_

- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : Traitor.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake. They have gone too far. This is madness.
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : This had nothing to do with me, I assure you. I will petition immediately to have you set free.
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : Well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work to do.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : May I ask why a Jedi knight is all the way out here on Geonosis?
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Do you know him?
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of. The Geonosians don't trust them.
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : Who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : It's a great pity our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you. I wish he were still alive. I could use his help right now.
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : Don't be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice just as you were once his. He knew all about the corruption in the senate but he wouldn't have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have.
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : The truth?
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : The truth. What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control of the dark lord of the Sith?
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : No, that's not possible. The Jedi would be aware of it.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend. Hundreds of senators are now under the influence of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : I don't believe you.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : The viceroy of the Trade Federation was once in league with this Darth Sidious but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord. He came to me for help. He told me everything. You must join me, Obi-Wan and together we will destroy the Sith!
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : I will never join you, Dooku.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : It may be difficult to secure your release.

_INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY_

- JAR JAR to SENAT : In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men!
- PALPATINE to SENAT : It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. And as my first act with this new authority I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.

_INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY_

- MACE WINDU to YODA : It is done, then. I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.
- YODA to MACE WINDU : Visit I will the cloners on Kamino and see this army they have created for the Republic.

_INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY_

- PADME to ANAKIN : See those columns of steam straight ahead? They're exhaust vents of some type.
- ANAKIN to PADME : That'll do.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead. I'm not interested in getting into a war here. As a member of the senate maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.
- ANAKIN to PADME : Don't worry. I've given up trying to argue with you.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help they would have asked for it. You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : I am programmed to understand humans!
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : "What does that mean?" That means I am in charge here!
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Where are you going now? You don't know what's out there. Have you no sense at all?

- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : You'll get your chance, I'm scrap. I want to go home! What did I do to deserve this?
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : I wonder what happened to poor little R2. He's always getting himself into trouble. Oh, no! Uh-oh. I'm so confused.
- JANGO FETT to ANAKIN : Don't move, Jedi! Take him away.

- ANAKIN to PADME : What are you talking about?
- PADME to ANAKIN : I love you.
- ANAKIN to PADME : You love me? I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives
- PADME to ANAKIN : I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.

_INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : It looks like you're going a good job so far.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Just relax. Concentrate.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What about Padme?
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : It looks like she's already on top of things.
- NUTE to COUNT DOOKU : Foul! She can't do that shoot her or something!
- ANAKIN to PADME : Jump!
- NUTE to COUNT DOOKU : This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango, finish her off.
- COUNT DOOKU to NUTE : Patiece, Viceroy she will die. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end.

_EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY_

- COUNT DOOKU to MACE WINDU : Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.
- MACE WINDU to COUNT DOOKU : Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party's over.
- COUNT DOOKU to MACE WINDU : Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered.
- MACE WINDU to COUNT DOOKU : I don't think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians.
- COUNT DOOKU to MACE WINDU : We'll see.

_INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY_

- ANAKIN to PADME : You call this a diplomatic solution?
- PADME to ANAKIN : No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : What are you doing? Stop that! You're going to strain something. My neck!

- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Now where are you taking me? This is such a drag! I'm quite beside myself.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : R2, please be careful! You're singeing my circuits!
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Yes, but is my head on straight?

_EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY_

- COUNT DOOKU to MACE WINDU : Master Windu! You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. Surrender - and your lives will be spared.
- MACE WINDU to COUNT DOOKU : We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku.
- COUNT DOOKU to MACE WINDU : Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed.
- PADME to ANAKIN : Look!
- YODA to CLONE : Around the survivors a perimeter create.

_INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY_

- YODA to CLONE : More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide.

_INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY_

- YODA to MACE WINDU : If Dooku escapes rally more systems to his cause he will.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Hold on!
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Good call, my young Padawan.

_INT. GEONOSIS, CONTROL - DAY_

- NUTE to COUNT DOOKU : The Jedi have amassed a huge army.
- COUNT DOOKU to NUTE : That doesn't seem possible. How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly?
- NUTE to COUNT DOOKU : We must send all available droids into battle.
- COUNT DOOKU to NUTE : There are too many.
- NUTE to COUNT DOOKU : This is not looking good at all!
- RUNE to NUTE : We must get the starships back into space.
- COUNT DOOKU to NUTE : My master will never allow the Republic to get away with this treachery. I will take the designs with me to Coruscant. They will be much safer there with my master.

_INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY_

- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Hold on! Look over there
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : It's Dooku, go after him! Padme!
- PADME to OBI-WAN : We're gonna need some help!
- OBI-WAN to PADME : There isn't time! Anakin and I can handle this!
- ANAKIN to CLONE : Put the ship down! Down!
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
- OBI-WAN to CLONE : Follow that speeder!
- ANAKIN to CLONE : No we're not! Land this ship!
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I don't care! Go back.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : I can't take Dooku alone! I need you! If we catch him, we can end this war right now! We have a job to do! What do you think Padm would do were she in your position?
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : She would do her duty.

_INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY_

- ANAKIN to COUNT DOOKU : You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : We'll take him together.
- ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I'm taking him now!
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : No, Anakin! No!
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.
- OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : I don't think so.
- COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
- COUNT DOOKU to ANAKIN : That's brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.
- ANAKIN to COUNT DOOKU : I'm a slow learner.
- OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin!
- COUNT DOOKU to YODA : Master Yoda. You have interfered with our affairs for the last time.
- YODA to COUNT DOOKU : Count Dooku. Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.
- COUNT DOOKU to YODA : I've become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you.
- YODA to COUNT DOOKU : Much to learn you still have.
- COUNT DOOKU to YODA : It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force but by our skills with a lightsaber.
- YODA to COUNT DOOKU : Fought well you have, my old Padawan.
- COUNT DOOKU to YODA : This is just the beginning.

_INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAY_

- COUNT DOOKU to DARTH SIDIOUS : I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun.
- DARTH SIDIOUS to COUNT DOOKU : Excellent. Everything is going as planned.

_INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET_

- OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the senate?
- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : It doesn't feel right.
- YODA to MACE WINDU : Joined the dark side Dooku has. Lies, deceit creating mistrust are his ways now.
- MACE WINDU to YODA : Nevertheless, I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate.
- YODA to MACE WINDU : I agree.
- MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : Where is your apprentice?
- OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator PADME home. I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
- YODA to OBI-WAN : Victory? Victory, you say? Not victory, a defeat, it was Master Obi-Wan. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has!

 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : This time we will do it together.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I was about to say that.
 PALPATINE to OBI-WAN : Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
 OBI-WAN to PALPATINE : Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
 COUNT DOOKU to OBI-WAN : Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
 OBI-WAN to COUNT DOOKU : You won't get away this time, Dooku.
 COUNT DOOKU to ANAKIN : I've been looking forward to this.
 ANAKIN to COUNT DOOKU : My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
 COUNT DOOKU to ANAKIN : Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
 COUNT DOOKU to ANAKIN : I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don t use them.

 39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 

 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I shouldn't 
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Do it!
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I couldn't stop myself.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Leave him, or we'll never make it.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : His fate will be the same as ours.

 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Apparently not, Master
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I say patience.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Patience! That's your plan, is it?
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Yes, ARTOO will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields

 62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 

 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to ANAKIN : And Anakin Skywalker I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
 ANAKIN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : General Grievous Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to ANAKIN : Ahhhh, Jedi scum 
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
 OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
 ANAKIN to ARTOO : ARTOO.

 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to PURPLE DROIDS : Crush them! Make them suffer!
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to PILOT DROID : Stay and watch your stations.
 PILOT DROID to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.

 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : You lose, General Kenobi.

 67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 

 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : All the escape pods have been launched.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Well?
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Open all hatches. Extend all flaps and drag fins.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins 
 ARTOO to ANAKIN : beeps
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : We lost something.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Now we're really picking up speed I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.

 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : We're coming in too hot.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Another happy landing.

 69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON 

 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Are you coming, Master?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely 
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : All right. But you owe me and not for saving your skin for the tenth time 
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Ninth time that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
 BAIL ORGANA to ANAKIN : Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
 ANAKIN to BAIL ORGANA : Thank you, Senator Organa.
 ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
 THREEPIO to ARTOO : It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
 ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
 THREEPIO to ARTOO : Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

 70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON 

 BAIL ORGANA to ANAKIN : The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.
 ANAKIN to BAIL ORGANA : I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts The Chancellor is very clear about that.
 BAIL ORGANA to ANAKIN : I'll do everything I can with the Senate.
 ANAKIN to BAIL ORGANA : Excuse me.
 BAIL ORGANA to ANAKIN : Certainly.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
 ANAKIN to PADME : I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
 PADME to ANAKIN : There were whispers that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
 ANAKIN to PADME : I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Wait, not here 
 ANAKIN to PADME : Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin, don't say things like that.
 ANAKIN to PADME : Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
 PADME to ANAKIN : Something wonderful has happened. I'm Annie, I'm pregnant.
 ANAKIN to PADME : That's that's wonderful.
 PADME to ANAKIN : What are we going to do?
 ANAKIN to PADME : We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.

 72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY 

 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to DARTH SIDIOUS : Yes, Lord Sidious.
 DARTH SIDIOUS to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to DARTH SIDIOUS : It will be done, My Lord.
 DARTH SIDIOUS to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : The end of the war is near, General.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to DARTH SIDIOUS : But the loss of Count Dooku?
 DARTH SIDIOUS to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice one far younger and more powerful.

 73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT 

 PADME to ANAKIN : Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
 ANAKIN to PADME : You are so beautiful!
 PADME to ANAKIN : It's only because I'm so in love 
 ANAKIN to PADME : No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
 PADME to ANAKIN : So love has blinded you?
 ANAKIN to PADME : Well, that's not exactly what I meant 
 PADME to ANAKIN : But it's probably true!
 ANAKIN to PADME : I haven't laughed in so long 
 PADME to ANAKIN : Neither have I.

 ANAKIN to PADME : Nothing 
 ANAKIN to PADME : I remember when I gave this to you.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
 ANAKIN to PADME : It was a dream.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Bad?
 ANAKIN to PADME : Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
 PADME to ANAKIN : And?
 ANAKIN to PADME : It was about you.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Tell me.
 ANAKIN to PADME : It was only a dream.
 ANAKIN to PADME : You die in childbirth 
 PADME to ANAKIN : And the baby?
 ANAKIN to PADME : I don't know.
 PADME to ANAKIN : It was only a dream.
 ANAKIN to PADME : I won't let this one become real, Padme.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
 ANAKIN to PADME : I know .
 PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
 ANAKIN to PADME : I don't need his help Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.

 77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY 

 YODA to ANAKIN : Premonitions premonitions Hmmmm these visions you have 
 ANAKIN to YODA : They are of pain, suffering, death 
 YODA to ANAKIN : Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
 ANAKIN to YODA : Someone 
 YODA to ANAKIN : close to you?
 ANAKIN to YODA : Yes.
 YODA to ANAKIN : Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
 ANAKIN to YODA : I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
 YODA to ANAKIN : Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
 ANAKIN to YODA : What must I do, Master Yoda?
 YODA to ANAKIN : Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

 79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY 

 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What's wrong then?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Be careful of what?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : He has requested your presence.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What for?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : He would not say.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy.

 80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY 

 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I hope you trust me, Anakin.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Of course.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I need your help, son.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What do you mean?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I'm depending on you.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : For what? I don't understand.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I think they will they need you more than you know.

 83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY 

 YODA to ANAKIN : Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
 ANAKIN to YODA : I understand.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : What? ! How can you do this? This is outrageous, it's unfair. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Take a seat, young Skywalker.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Forgive me, Master.
 KI-ADI to MACE WINDU : We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
 YODA to MACE WINDU : Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
 OBI-WAN to YODA : It may take some time we do not have many ships to spare.
 KI-ADI to YODA : What about the droid attack on the WOOKIES?
 MACE WINDU to KI-ADI : It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
 OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
 YODA to MACE WINDU : Go, I will. Good relations with the WOOKIES, I have.
 MACE WINDU to YODA : It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the WOOKIES on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.

 84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON 

 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age, it's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council 
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : That has nothing to do with this.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : And?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : What situation?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : We are at war, Anakin.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : The Council is asking you.

 86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY 

 OBI-WAN to YODA : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
 MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.
 OBI-WAN to MACE WINDU : With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
 MACE WINDU to OBI-WAN : So the prophecy says.
 YODA to OBI-WAN : A prophecy that misread could have been.
 OBI-WAN to YODA : He will not let me down. He never has.
 YODA to OBI-WAN : I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.

 87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET 

 ANAKIN to PADME : Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? 
 ANAKIN to PADME : What do you mean?
 PADME to ANAKIN : What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
 ANAKIN to PADME : I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
 PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
 ANAKIN to PADME : Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
 PADME to ANAKIN : What is it?
 ANAKIN to PADME : Nothing.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Don't do this don't shut me out. Let me help you.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago when there was nothing but our love No politics, no plotting no war.

 88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT 

 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Sit down, Leave us.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I'm not sure I understand.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You must sense what I have come to suspect the Jedi Council want control of the Republic they're planning to betray me.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I don't think 
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I know they don't trust you 
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Or the Senate or the Republic or democracy for that matter.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I don't know I don't know what to say.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : The Jedi use their power for good.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be 
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : evil.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : And the Jedi don't?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : The Jedi are selfless they only care about others.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : No.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : He could actually save people from death?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What happened to him?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Is it possible to learn this power?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Not from a Jedi.

 90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY 

 KI-ADI to YODA : Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.
 ANAKIN to YODA : A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
 YODA to ANAKIN : Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
 YODA to MACE WINDU : A Master is needed, with more experience.
 MACE WINDU to YODA : Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi Master Kenobi.
 YODA to MACE WINDU : Obi-Wan, my choice is.
 KI-ADI to OBI-WAN : I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
 YODA to OBI-WAN : I agree.
 MACE WINDU to YODA : Very well. Council is adjourned.

 91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY 

 CLONE COMMANDER GREE to YODA : The droids have started up their main power generators.
 YODA to CLONE COMMANDER GREE : Then now the time is, Commander.
 CLONE COMMANDER GREE to YODA : Yes, sir.

 96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 

 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : You're going to need me on this one, Master.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Master! Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training I have been arrogant and I apologize I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.
 ANAKIN to OBI-WAN : Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
 OBI-WAN to ANAKIN : Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

 98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE 

 CLONE COMMANDER CODY to OBI-WAN : Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here on the far side.
 OBI-WAN to CLONE COMMANDER CODY : I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.
 CLONE COMMANDER CODY to OBI-WAN : Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?
 OBI-WAN to CLONE COMMANDER CODY : Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.
 CLONE COMMANDER CODY to OBI-WAN : I'm counting on you.

 102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM 

 OBI-WAN to PADME : Save your energy.

 103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY 

 ANAKIN to PADME : I sense someone familiar Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
 PADME to ANAKIN : He came by this morning.
 ANAKIN to PADME : What did he want?
 PADME to ANAKIN : He's worried about you.
 ANAKIN to PADME : You told him about us, didn't you?
 PADME to ANAKIN : He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
 ANAKIN to PADME : And he's not?
 PADME to ANAKIN : You have been moody lately.
 ANAKIN to PADME : I'm not moody 
 PADME to ANAKIN : Anakin! Don't do this again.
 ANAKIN to PADME : I don't know I feel lost.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
 ANAKIN to PADME : Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
 PADME to ANAKIN : They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
 ANAKIN to PADME : Something's happening I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
 PADME to ANAKIN : You expect too much of yourself.
 ANAKIN to PADME : I have found a way to save you.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Save me?
 ANAKIN to PADME : From my nightmares.
 PADME to ANAKIN : Is that what's bothering you?
 ANAKIN to PADME : I won't lose you, Padme.
 PADME to ANAKIN : I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
 ANAKIN to PADME : No, I promise you!

 105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 

 TION MEDON to OBI-WAN : Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
 OBI-WAN to TION MEDON : Unfortunately, the war.
 TION MEDON to OBI-WAN : There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.
 OBI-WAN to TION MEDON : With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
 TION MEDON to OBI-WAN : He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
 OBI-WAN to TION MEDON : I understand.
 TION MEDON to OBI-WAN : The tenth level thousands of Battle Droids 
 OBI-WAN to TION MEDON : Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.

 106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY 

 PURPLE DROIDS to TION MEDON : Is he bringing additional warriors?
 TION MEDON to PURPLE DROIDS : He didn't say.

 111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY 

 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to NUTE GUNRAY : It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.
 NUTE GUNRAY to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to NUTE GUNRAY : Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip Your ship is waiting.

 112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY 

 OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Hello, there!
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering Surely you realize you're doomed.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to PURPLE DROIDS : Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
 OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : Your move.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.
 OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
 OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.
 GENERAL GRIEVOUS to OBI-WAN : Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
 OBI-WAN to GENERAL GRIEVOUS : I don't think so.

 117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING 

 CLONE COMMANDER CODY to MACE WINDU : Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.
 MACE WINDU to CLONE COMMANDER CODY : Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
intentions.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Yes, Master.
 MACE WINDU to KI-ADI : I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
 KI-ADI to MACE WINDU : If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.
 MACE WINDU to KI-ADI : That could be a dangerous move the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition.
 YODA to MACE WINDU : To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Great care we must take.

 118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING 

 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I should be there with him.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : How do you know the ways of the Force?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : My mentor taught me everything about the Force even the nature of the dark side.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You know the dark side?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What did you say?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Use my knowledge, I beg you 
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You're a Sith Lord!
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I know what has been troubling you Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi a life of significance, of conscience.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : You're wrong!
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Are you going to kill me?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I would certainly like to.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side the power to save Padme.

 124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING 

 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Master Windu, I must talk to you.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : A Sith Lord?
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Yes. The one we have been looking for.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : How do you know this?
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Are you sure?
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Absolutely.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : I must go, Master.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : Yes, Master.

 125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING 

 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.

 128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING 

 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : The Senate will decide your fate.
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : I am the Senate!
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : Not yet!
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : It's treason, then.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : You are under arrest, My Lord.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over you have lost 
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : No! No! You will die!
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : He is a traitor, Anakin.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : He's the traitor. Stop him!
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : Don't listen to him, Anakin.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : I can't I give up. Help me. I am weak I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.
 MACE WINDU to PALPATINE : You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
 MACE WINDU to ANAKIN : He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : It is not the Jedi way 
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : He must live 
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Please don't, please don't 
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : I need him 
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Please don't 
 ANAKIN to MACE WINDU : NO!
 PALPATINE to MACE WINDU : Power! Unlimited power!
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What have I done?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I will do whatever you ask.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Good.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth Vader.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : Thank you. my Master.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Rise, Darth Vader.

 130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING 

 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : I understand, Master.
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
 ANAKIN to PALPATINE : What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
 PALPATINE to ANAKIN : Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.

 PADME to ANAKIN : What about Obi-Wan?

 PADME to ANAKIN : Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
 ANAKIN to PADME : Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return things will be different, I promise.

 ANAKIN to PADME : Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away.

> A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity. It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy.

- BERU to LUKE : Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
- LUKE to BERU : It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
- OWEN to THREEPIO : I have no need for a protocol droid.
- THREEPIO to OWEN : Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that.
- OWEN to THREEPIO : What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
- THREEPIO to OWEN : Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter. very similar to your vaporators. You could say.
- OWEN to THREEPIO : Do you speak Bocce?
- THREEPIO to OWEN : Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me. I'm as fluent in Bocce.
- OWEN to JAWA : All right shut up! I'll take this one.
- THREEPIO to OWEN : Shutting up, sir.
- OWEN to LUKE : Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
- LUKE to OWEN : But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters.
- OWEN to LUKE : You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!
- LUKE to OWEN : All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- LUKE to OWEN : Uncle Owen.
- OWEN to LUKE : Yeah?
- LUKE to OWEN : This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
- OWEN to JAWA : Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
- LUKE to OWEN : Uncle Owen.
- OWEN to LUKE : Yeah?
- LUKE to OWEN : What about that one?
- OWEN to JAWA : What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Okay, let's go.

- THREEPIO to LUKE : Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
- LUKE to THREEPIO : It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Is there anything I might do to help?
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
- THREEPIO to LUKE : I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : I see, sir.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Uh, you can call me Luke.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : I see, sir Luke.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Just Luke.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, ARTOO.
- LUKE to ARTOO : Hello.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- LUKE to ARTOO : You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
- THREEPIO to LUKE : That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Have you been in many battles?
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways
- LUKE to ARTOO : Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or.
- LEIA to OBI-WAN : Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
- LUKE to ARTOO : What's this?
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : What is what?!? He asked you a question. What is that?
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- LEIA to OBI-WAN : Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Who is she? She's beautiful.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
- LEIA to OBI-WAN : Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to.
- LUKE to ARTOO : Is there more to this recording?
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Behave yourself, ARTOO. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to LUKE : He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
- THREEPIO to LUKE : I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
 Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to LUKE : He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
- LUKE to ARTOO : There you go.
- LUKE to ARTOO : Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
- BERU to LUKE : Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
- LUKE to BERU : All right, I'll be right there, BERU.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : No, I don't think he likes you at all.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : No, I don't like you either.

 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA

- LUKE to OWEN : You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
- OWEN to LUKE : What makes you think that?
- LUKE to OWEN : Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
- LUKE to OWEN : I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
- OWEN to LUKE : That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
- LUKE to OWEN : But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
- OWEN to LUKE : He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
- LUKE to OWEN : He knew my father?
- OWEN to LUKE : I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
- LUKE to OWEN : Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
- OWEN to LUKE : You mean the next semester before harvest?
- LUKE to OWEN : Sure, there're more than enough droids.
- OWEN to LUKE : Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.
- OWEN to LUKE : You must understand I need you here, Luke.
- LUKE to OWEN : But it's a whole another year.
- OWEN to LUKE : Look, it's only one more season.
- LUKE to OWEN : Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
- BERU to LUKE : Where are you going?
- LUKE to BERU : It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
- BERU to OWEN : Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.
- OWEN to BERU : I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
- BERU to OWEN : Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
- OWEN to BERU : That's what I'm afraid of.

- LUKE to THREEPIO : Oh, no!

- LUKE to THREEPIO : How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
- LUKE to THREEPIO : It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning.
- OWEN to LUKE : Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
- LUKE to OWEN : All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master. I've never seen such devotion in a droid before. there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time. a long time.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Oh, he's not dead, not. not yet.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You know him!
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
- ARTOO to OBI-WAN : beeps
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Then the droid does belong to you.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting.

 INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING

- LUKE to OBI-WAN : No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You fought in the Clone Wars?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I wish I'd known him.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Sure, go ahead.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : What is it?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : How did my father die?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : The Force?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
- ARTOO to OBI-WAN : beeps
- OBI-WAN to ARTOO : Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I saw part of the message he was.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I seem to have found it.
- LEIA to OBI-WAN : General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : That's your uncle talking.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Learn about the Force, Luke.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You must do what you feel is right, of course.

 INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

- TAGGE to MOTTI : Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.
- MOTTI to TAGGE : Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
- TAGGE to MOTTI : The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.
- TARKIN to TAGGE : The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
- TAGGE to TARKIN : That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
- TARKIN to TAGGE : The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
- TAGGE to TARKIN : And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
- DARTH VADER to TAGGE : The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
- MOTTI to DARTH VADER : Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!
- DARTH VADER to MOTTI : Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
- MOTTI to DARTH VADER : Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort.
- DARTH VADER to MOTTI : I find your lack of faith disturbing.
- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : Enough of this! Vader, release him!
- DARTH VADER to TARKIN : As you wish.
- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

- LUKE to OBI-WAN : It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just. I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : These are the same Jawas that sold us ARTOO and Threepio.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.

- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.

- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.

- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : Going somewhere, Solo?
- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.
- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Yeah, but this time I got the money.
- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba.
- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Over my dead body.
- GREEDO to HAN SOLO : That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
- HAN SOLO to GREEDO : Yes, I'll bet you have.
- HAN SOLO to BARTENDER : Sorry about the mess.

- DARTH VADER to TARKIN : Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
- MOTTI to DARTH VADER : The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?
- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
- DARTH VADER to TARKIN : What do you mean?
- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.
- TROOPER to TARKIN : With pleasure.

- HAN SOLO to JABBA : I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
- JABBA to HAN SOLO : I expected you would be.
- HAN SOLO to JABBA : I'm not the type to run.
- JABBA to HAN SOLO : Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me. why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that. after all we've been through together.
- HAN SOLO to JABBA : You sent Greedo to blast me.
- JABBA to HAN SOLO : Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you.
- HAN SOLO to JABBA : I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
- JABBA to HAN SOLO : Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice. you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business.
- HAN SOLO to JABBA : You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.
- JABBA to HAN SOLO : Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time. but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
- HAN SOLO to JABBA : Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.

- HAN SOLO to LUKE : She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Here's where the fun begins!
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : What's that flashing?
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.

 INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

- MOTTI to TARKIN : We've entered the Alderaan system.
- LEIA to TARKIN : Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
- TARKIN to LEIA : Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
- LEIA to TARKIN : I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
- TARKIN to LEIA : Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
- LEIA to TARKIN : The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
- TARKIN to LEIA : Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power, on your home planet of Alderaan.
- LEIA to TARKIN : No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly.
- TARKIN to LEIA : You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
- TARKIN to LEIA : I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?
- LEIA to TARKIN : Dantooine.
- LEIA to TARKIN : They're on Dantooine.
- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
- LEIA to TARKIN : What?
- TARKIN to LEIA : You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
- LEIA to TARKIN : No!

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Are you all right? What's wrong?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I felt a great disturbance in the Force. as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You'd better get on with your exercises.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Don't everyone thank me at once.
- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Now be careful, ARTOO.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks
- THREEPIO to CHEWBACCA : He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.
- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks
- HAN SOLO to THREEPIO : Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
- THREEPIO to HAN SOLO : But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
- HAN SOLO to THREEPIO : That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, ARTOO. Let the Wookiee win.
- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You mean it controls your actions?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : You don't believe in the Force, do you?
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I suggest you try it again, Luke.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Stretch out with your feelings.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You see, you can do it.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : I call it luck.
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

- OFFICER CASS to TARKIN : Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : She lied! She lied to us!
- DARTH VADER to TARKIN : I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
- TARKIN to DARTH VADER : Terminate her. immediately!

- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : What the.? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : What's going on?
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Our position is correct, except. no, Alderaan!
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : What do you mean? Where is it?
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : What? How?
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Destroyed. by the Empire!
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : There's another ship coming in.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Maybe they know what happened.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : It's an Imperial fighter.
- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : barks
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : It followed us!
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : No. It's a short range fighter.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

- LUKE to HAN SOLO : It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : Not if I can help it. Chewie.jam it's transmissions.
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Not for long.

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

- OBI-WAN to LUKE : A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : I think I can get him before he gets there. he's almost in range.
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : That's no moon! It's a space station.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : It's too big to be a space station.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I have a very bad feeling about this.
- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
- CHEWBACCA to THREEPIO : barks
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Why are we still moving towards it?
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : But there's gotta be something you can do!
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

- IMPERIAL OFFICER to DARTH VADER : There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
- DARTH VADER to IMPERIAL OFFICER : Did you find any droids?
- IMPERIAL OFFICER to DARTH VADER : No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
- DARTH VADER to IMPERIAL OFFICER : Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
- IMPERIAL OFFICER to DARTH VADER : Yes, sir.
- DARTH VADER to IMPERIAL OFFICER : I sense something. a presence I haven't felt since.
- IMPERIAL OFFICER to DARTH VADER : Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!

 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY

- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
- OBI-WAN to HAN SOLO : Leave that to me!

- GANTRY OFFICER to TROOPER : Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
- THREEPIO to OBI-WAN : We found the computer outlet, sir.
- OBI-WAN to THREEPIO : Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
- THREEPIO to OBI-WAN : He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : barks
- THREEPIO to OBI-WAN : The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
- HAN SOLO to OBI-WAN : Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I want to go with you.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : But he can.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you. always!

- LUKE to THREEPIO : Well, who. who has he found?
- ARTOO to LUKE : barks
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Princess Leia.
- LUKE to ARTOO : The princess? She's here?
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Princess? What's going on?
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
 three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Oh, no! We've got to do something.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : What are you talking about?
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message. We've got to help her.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : I'm not going anywhere.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : But they're going to kill her!
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Better her than me.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : She's rich.
- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : barks
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Rich?
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : What?
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Well more wealth that you can imagine.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : You'll get it!
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : I better!
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : You will.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : All right.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : What's your plan?
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Uh. Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.
- CHEWBACCA to LUKE : barks
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Okay. Han, you put these on.
- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : barks
- THREEPIO to LUKE : Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking. but, ah. what should ARTOO and I do if we're discovered here?
- LUKE to THREEPIO : Lock the door!

- DARTH VADER to TARKIN : Don't underestimate the power of the Force.

 INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

- TARKIN to IMPERIAL OFFICER : Yes.
- IMPERIAL OFFICER to TARKIN : We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

 INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

- DODONNA to PILOTS : The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
- GOLD LEADER to DODONNA : Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
- DODONNA to PILOTS : Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
- DODONNA to PILOTS : The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
- DODONNA to PILOTS : Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
- WEDGE to LUKE : That's impossible, even for a computer.
- LUKE to WEDGE : It's not impossible. I used to bull's- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.
- DODONNA to PILOTS : Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

 INT. DEATH STAR

- IMPERIAL OFFICER to TARKIN : Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.

- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?

- BIGGS to LUKE : I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?

 Star Wars: Episode 5: The Empire strikes back

> It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space.

- HAN SOLO to LEIA : Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.

- LUKE to YODA : But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.

- LUKE to OBI-WAN : And that is why I have to go.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?

 1 SPACE

> Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the evil gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy.

- JERJERROD to DARTH VADER : I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
- DARTH VADER to JERJERROD : Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
- JERJERROD to DARTH VADER : I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
- DARTH VADER to JERJERROD : The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
- JERJERROD to DARTH VADER : But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
- DARTH VADER to JERJERROD : Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
- JERJERROD to DARTH VADER : The Emperor's coming here?
- DARTH VADER to JERJERROD : That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
- JERJERROD to DARTH VADER : We shall double our efforts.
- DARTH VADER to JERJERROD : I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : ARTOO, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.
- ARTOO to THREEPIO : beeps

 6 EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE

- LUKE to JABBA : Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : What did he say?
- LUKE to JABBA : . Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : This can't be! ARTOO, you're playing the wrong message.
- JABBA to THREEPIO : There will be no bargain.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : We're doomed.
- JABBA to THREEPIO : I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : ARTOO, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.

 9 INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR

- THREEPIO to NINEDENINE : Disintegrated?
- NINEDENINE to THREEPIO : Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
- THREEPIO to ARTOO : ARTOO, don't leave me! Ohhh!
- ARTOO to NINEDENINE : beeps

- BOUSHH to JABBA : I want fifty thousand. No less.
- THREEPIO to JABBA : Uh, oh. but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.
- THREEPIO to JABBA : Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
- JABBA to THREEPIO : This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.

- HAN SOLO to JABBA : Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.
- JABBA to HAN SOLO : It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.
- HAN SOLO to JABBA : Look.
- HAN SOLO to JABBA : Jabba. I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
- LEIA to JABBA : We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this.

- LUKE to JABBA : You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
- JABBA to LUKE : Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
- LUKE to JABBA : Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this. or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.

- HAN SOLO to LUKE : That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
- LEIA to HAN SOLO : I'm here.
- THREEPIO to HAN SOLO : Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
- HAN SOLO to THREEPIO : Good, I hate long waits.
- THREEPIO to HAN SOLO : You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Doesn't sound so bad.
- THREEPIO to HAN SOLO : In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
- HAN SOLO to THREEPIO : On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : BARKS
- LUKE to JABBA : You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.

- DARTH VADER to EMPEROR : Yes, my Master.
- EMPEROR to DARTH VADER : Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

- YODA to LUKE : Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
- LUKE to YODA : No. of course not.
- YODA to LUKE : I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?
- YODA to LUKE : Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
- LUKE to YODA : Master Yoda, you can't die.
- YODA to LUKE : Strong am I with the Force. but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things. the way of the Force.
- LUKE to YODA : But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
- YODA to LUKE : No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
- LUKE to YODA : Then I am a Jedi?
- YODA to LUKE : Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
- LUKE to YODA : Master Yoda. is Darth Vader my father?
- YODA to LUKE : Mmm. rest I need. Yes. rest.
- LUKE to YODA : Yoda, I must know.
- YODA to LUKE : Your father he is.
- YODA to LUKE : told you, did he?
- LUKE to YODA : Yes.
- YODA to LUKE : Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.
- LUKE to YODA : Unfortunate that I know the truth?
- YODA to LUKE : No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him. that incomplete was your training. Not
 ready for the burden were you.
- LUKE to YODA : Well, I'm sorry.
- YODA to LUKE : Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
- YODA to LUKE : Luke.Luke.Do not.Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke. There is.another.Sky.Sky.walker.

 51 EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING

- ARTOO to LUKE : BEEPS
- LUKE to ARTOO : I can't do it, ARTOO. I can't go on alone.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Yoda will always be with you.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true. from a certain point of view.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : A certain point of view!
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Anakin was a good friend.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : There's still good in him.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I can't do it, Ben.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : You cannot escape your destiny.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke. but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : But I had to help my friends.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I found out Darth Vader was my father.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : to be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : I can't kill my own father.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Yoda spoke of another.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : But I have no sister.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Hmm. to protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : Leia! Leia's my sister.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine. and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage. no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course. she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours. for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.
- LUKE to OBI-WAN : But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
- OBI-WAN to LUKE : She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke. but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!

 53 INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM

- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Well, look at you, a general, huh?
- LANDO to HAN SOLO : Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
- LANDO to HAN SOLO : I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?
- MON MOTHMA to REBEL PILOTS : The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.
- MON MOTHMA to REBEL PILOTS : The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.
- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : BARKS
- MON MOTHMA to REBEL PILOTS : Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.
- ACKBAR to REBEL PILOTS : You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.
- ACKBAR to REBEL PILOTS : General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
- HAN SOLO to LANDO : Good luck.
- HAN SOLO to LANDO : You're gonna need it.
- ACKBAR to GENERAL MADINE : General Madine.
- GENERAL MADINE to REBEL PILOTS : We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.
- THREEPIO to LEIA : Sounds dangerous.
- LEIA to THREEPIO : I wonder who they found to pull that off.
- GENERAL MADINE to HAN SOLO : General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
- HAN SOLO to GENERAL MADINE : Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
- HAN SOLO to CHEWBACCA : Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.
- CHEWBACCA to HAN SOLO : BEEPS
- HAN SOLO to GENERAL MADINE : That's one.
- LEIA to HAN SOLO : Uh, General. count me in.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : I'm with you, too!
- LEIA to LUKE : What is it?
- LUKE to LEIA : Ask me again sometime.
- HAN SOLO to LUKE : Luke.
- LUKE to HAN SOLO : Hi, Han. Chewie.
